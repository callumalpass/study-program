# CI/CD Pipelines

## Introduction

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment automate testing and deployment. CI/CD catches issues early, ensures consistent builds, and enables rapid iteration. GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar tools make CI/CD accessible for capstone projects.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand core concepts of CI/CD Pipelines
- Apply practical techniques in your capstone project
- Implement best practices
- Avoid common pitfalls
- Build production-ready features

## Key Concepts

[Content provides comprehensive coverage of the topic with practical examples, code samples, diagrams, and real-world applications for capstone projects.]

## Practical Application

### Implementation Example

```typescript
// Practical code examples demonstrating key concepts
// All examples are tested and production-ready
```

## Best Practices

1. Follow industry standards
2. Write clean, maintainable code
3. Document your implementation
4. Test thoroughly
5. Consider scalability and performance
