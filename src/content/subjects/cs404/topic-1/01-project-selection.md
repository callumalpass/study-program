## Decision-Making Framework

### Project Comparison Matrix

Create a matrix to evaluate multiple project ideas objectively:

```
Criteria                | Weight | Project A | Project B | Project C
------------------------|--------|-----------|-----------|----------
Personal Interest       | 20%    | 8/10      | 9/10      | 6/10
Technical Feasibility   | 25%    | 7/10      | 5/10      | 9/10
Learning Value          | 20%    | 8/10      | 9/10      | 6/10
Impact & Portfolio      | 20%    | 6/10      | 8/10      | 7/10
Resource Availability   | 15%    | 9/10      | 6/10      | 8/10
------------------------|--------|-----------|-----------|----------
Weighted Score          | 100%   | 7.5       | 7.4       | 7.3
```

Rate each criterion on a scale of 1-10, apply weights based on your priorities, and calculate weighted scores.

### Risk Assessment

For your top choices, conduct a risk assessment:

**Technical Risks:**
- What could go wrong technically?
- What are your mitigation strategies?
- Do you have plan B for high-risk components?

**Schedule Risks:**
- What could cause delays?
- How much buffer time do you have?
- Can you reduce scope if needed?

**External Risks:**
- What external factors could impact the project?
- How dependent are you on third parties?
- What's your contingency plan?

### The Goldilocks Principle

Your project should be "just right":

**Too Easy:**
- Uses only technologies you've mastered
- Could be completed in a few days
- Doesn't demonstrate growth or learning
- Won't impress evaluators or employers

**Too Hard:**
- Requires learning entirely new paradigms
- Depends on complex systems you don't understand
- Has unclear scope or requirements
- Likely to be abandoned due to overwhelm

**Just Right:**
- Builds on existing skills while introducing new challenges
- Has clear core features and optional extensions
- Demonstrates multiple competencies
- Achievable with focused effort

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Scope Creep Vulnerability

Some project types are particularly susceptible to scope creep:
- Social networks (endless features to add)
- Games (always "just one more level")
- Marketplaces (two-sided platforms are complex)
- AI projects (improving accuracy is never-ending)

If choosing these types, define strict MVP boundaries upfront.

### Technology Overload

Avoid projects that require:
- Learning multiple new frameworks simultaneously
- Complex infrastructure you've never worked with
- Cutting-edge technologies with poor documentation
- Deep expertise in unfamiliar domains

You should learn new things, but not everything should be new.

### Dependency Traps

Be cautious of projects that depend on:
- Third-party APIs that could change or disappear
- Access to proprietary data or systems
- Collaboration from other people or organizations
- Hardware or equipment you don't own

Ensure you have control over critical dependencies.

### Perfectionism Paralysis

Avoid projects where:
- Quality bar is impossibly high (professional game graphics, enterprise-scale performance)
- Success depends on factors beyond your control (viral adoption, perfect UX)
- Requirements are too vague or aspirational

Focus on what you can realistically deliver and demonstrate.
