# Ideals

## Definition

**Definition**: Subset $I \subseteq R$ is a **(two-sided) ideal** if:
1. $(I, +)$ is a subgroup of $(R, +)$
2. For all $r \in R$ and $a \in I$: $ra \in I$ and $ar \in I$

## Examples

- $\{0\}$ and $R$ (trivial ideals)
- $n\mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ (all multiples of $n$)
- $\langle f(x) \rangle = \{g(x)f(x) : g \in R[x]\}$ in polynomial ring

## Principal Ideals

**Definition**: Ideal generated by single element $a$:
$$\langle a \rangle = \{ra : r \in R\}$$

**Theorem**: In $\mathbb{Z}$, every ideal is principal: $I = n\mathbb{Z}$ for some $n$.

## Maximal and Prime Ideals

**Maximal**: No proper ideal strictly contains it.

**Prime**: $ab \in I \Rightarrow a \in I$ or $b \in I$.

**Theorems**:
- $R/I$ is a field iff $I$ is maximal
- $R/I$ is integral domain iff $I$ is prime

## Summary

- Ideals generalize normal subgroups
- Principal ideals: generated by one element
- Foundation for quotient rings
- Maximal ideals give fields

Ideals are fundamental for ring theory, just as normal subgroups are for groups.
