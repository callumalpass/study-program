# Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups

## Statement of the Theorem

The Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups provides a complete classification of all cyclic groups and their subgroups.

**Theorem (Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups)**:

1. Every cyclic group is isomorphic to either $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}_n$ for some positive integer $n$.

2. If $G = \langle a \rangle$ is a cyclic group of order $n$, then for each positive divisor $d$ of $n$, there exists a unique subgroup of order $d$, namely $\langle a^{n/d} \rangle$.

3. The subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ are precisely $\langle d \rangle$ for each divisor $d$ of $n$.

## Part 1: Classification of Cyclic Groups

**Theorem 1**: Every cyclic group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}_n$ for some $n \geq 1$.

**Proof**: Let $G = \langle a \rangle$ be a cyclic group.

**Case 1**: $|a| = \infty$ (infinite cyclic)

Define $\phi: \mathbb{Z} \to G$ by $\phi(k) = a^k$.

- **Well-defined**: Each $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ maps to a unique element $a^k \in G$.
- **Homomorphism**: $\phi(m + n) = a^{m+n} = a^m \cdot a^n = \phi(m) \cdot \phi(n)$.
- **Injective**: If $\phi(m) = \phi(n)$, then $a^m = a^n$, so $a^{m-n} = e$. Since $|a| = \infty$, we need $m - n = 0$, hence $m = n$.
- **Surjective**: Every element of $G$ has form $a^k$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$, so $\phi(k) = a^k$.

Therefore, $\phi$ is an isomorphism and $G \cong \mathbb{Z}$.

**Case 2**: $|a| = n < \infty$ (finite cyclic)

Then $G = \{e, a, a^2, \ldots, a^{n-1}\}$ with $a^n = e$.

Define $\phi: \mathbb{Z}_n \to G$ by $\phi(k) = a^k$.

- **Well-defined**: Need to verify that if $k \equiv m \pmod{n}$, then $a^k = a^m$. If $k = m + qn$, then $a^k = a^{m+qn} = a^m(a^n)^q = a^m \cdot e^q = a^m$. ✓
- **Homomorphism**: $\phi(k + m) = a^{k+m} = a^k \cdot a^m = \phi(k) \cdot \phi(m)$.
- **Injective**: If $\phi(k) = \phi(m)$ with $0 \leq k, m < n$, then $a^k = a^m$. So $a^{k-m} = e$. Since $|a| = n$ and $|k - m| < n$, we need $k - m = 0$, hence $k = m$.
- **Surjective**: Every element of $G$ is $a^k$ for some $0 \leq k < n$, and $\phi(k) = a^k$.

Therefore, $\phi$ is an isomorphism and $G \cong \mathbb{Z}_n$. $\square$

**Consequence**: Up to isomorphism, there is exactly one cyclic group of each order. All structural questions about cyclic groups reduce to questions about $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}_n$.

## Part 2: Subgroup Structure

### Subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}$

**Theorem 2**: Every subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}$ has the form $n\mathbb{Z} = \{nk : k \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ for some $n \geq 0$.

**Proof**: Let $H \leq \mathbb{Z}$. If $H = \{0\}$, then $H = 0\mathbb{Z}$.

Otherwise, $H$ contains some positive integer (if $-m \in H$, then $m = -(-m) \in H$).

Let $n$ be the smallest positive integer in $H$. We claim $H = n\mathbb{Z}$.

($\supseteq$) Since $n \in H$ and $H$ is a subgroup, $nk \in H$ for all $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. Thus $n\mathbb{Z} \subseteq H$.

($\subseteq$) Let $m \in H$. By the division algorithm, $m = qn + r$ where $0 \leq r < n$. Then:
$$r = m - qn \in H$$
(since $m \in H$ and $qn \in H$).

Since $n$ is the smallest positive integer in $H$ and $0 \leq r < n$, we must have $r = 0$. Thus $m = qn \in n\mathbb{Z}$.

Therefore, $H = n\mathbb{Z}$. $\square$

**Lattice of Subgroups**: The subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}$ form a chain under inclusion:
$$\cdots \subseteq 6\mathbb{Z} \subseteq 3\mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$$

And $m\mathbb{Z} \subseteq n\mathbb{Z}$ if and only if $n | m$.

### Subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}_n$

**Theorem 3**: For each divisor $d$ of $n$, the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_n$ has a unique subgroup of order $d$, namely $\langle n/d \rangle$.

**Proof**: Let $d | n$, say $n = dk$.

First, show $|\langle k \rangle| = d$:
$$|\langle k \rangle| = |k| = \frac{n}{\gcd(n, k)} = \frac{dk}{\gcd(dk, k)} = \frac{dk}{k} = d$$

So $\langle k \rangle$ is a subgroup of order $d$.

For uniqueness, suppose $H \leq \mathbb{Z}_n$ with $|H| = d$. Since subgroups of cyclic groups are cyclic, $H = \langle m \rangle$ for some $m \in \mathbb{Z}_n$.

Then $d = |H| = |\langle m \rangle| = |m| = \frac{n}{\gcd(n, m)}$.

Thus $\gcd(n, m) = \frac{n}{d} = k$, which means $k | m$.

Write $m = kj$. Then:
$$\langle m \rangle = \langle kj \rangle = \langle k \rangle$$
(since $\gcd(j, d) = 1$ implies $\langle kj \rangle = \langle k \rangle$ in $\mathbb{Z}_n$).

Therefore, $H = \langle k \rangle$ is the unique subgroup of order $d$. $\square$

**Corollary**: The number of subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ equals the number of divisors of $n$.

### Examples

**Example 1**: Subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$

Divisors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12

Subgroups:
- Order 1: $\langle 0 \rangle = \{0\}$ (generated by $12/1 = 12 \equiv 0$)
- Order 2: $\langle 6 \rangle = \{0, 6\}$ (generated by $12/2 = 6$)
- Order 3: $\langle 4 \rangle = \{0, 4, 8\}$ (generated by $12/3 = 4$)
- Order 4: $\langle 3 \rangle = \{0, 3, 6, 9\}$ (generated by $12/4 = 3$)
- Order 6: $\langle 2 \rangle = \{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}$ (generated by $12/6 = 2$)
- Order 12: $\langle 1 \rangle = \mathbb{Z}_{12}$ (generated by $12/12 = 1$)

       <0>
```

**Example 2**: Subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}_{30}$

Divisors of 30: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30

The 8 subgroups are:
- $\langle 30 \rangle = \{0\}$ (order 1)
- $\langle 15 \rangle$ (order 2)
- $\langle 10 \rangle$ (order 3)
- $\langle 6 \rangle$ (order 5)
- $\langle 5 \rangle$ (order 6)
- $\langle 3 \rangle$ (order 10)
- $\langle 2 \rangle$ (order 15)
- $\langle 1 \rangle = \mathbb{Z}_{30}$ (order 30)

## Subgroup Lattice Properties

**Theorem 4**: If $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ with $|H| = d_1$ and $|K| = d_2$, then:
- $H \subseteq K$ if and only if $d_1 | d_2$
- $H \cap K$ has order $\gcd(d_1, d_2)$
- $H + K = \langle H \cup K \rangle$ has order $\text{lcm}(d_1, d_2)$

**Proof Sketch**: These follow from the correspondence between subgroups and divisors. $\square$

### Example

In $\mathbb{Z}_{36}$:
- $H = \langle 4 \rangle$ has order 9
- $K = \langle 6 \rangle$ has order 6
- $H \cap K = \langle 12 \rangle$ has order $\gcd(9, 6) = 3$
- $H + K = \langle 2 \rangle$ has order $\text{lcm}(9, 6) = 18$

Verification:
- $\gcd(9, 6) = 3$: $H \cap K = \langle \text{lcm}(4, 6) \rangle = \langle 12 \rangle$ ✓
- $\text{lcm}(9, 6) = 18$: $H + K = \langle \gcd(4, 6) \rangle = \langle 2 \rangle$ ✓

## Applications

### Counting Subgroups

**Problem**: How many subgroups does $\mathbb{Z}_{720}$ have?

**Solution**: Factor $720 = 16 \cdot 45 = 2^4 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5$.

Number of divisors: $(4+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 5 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 30$.

Therefore, $\mathbb{Z}_{720}$ has exactly 30 subgroups.

### Finding Specific Subgroups

**Problem**: Find all subgroups of order 15 in $\mathbb{Z}_{60}$.

**Solution**: We need subgroups of order 15. Since $15 | 60$, there is a unique subgroup of order 15, namely $\langle 60/15 \rangle = \langle 4 \rangle$.

$$\langle 4 \rangle = \{0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56\}$$

This is the only subgroup of order 15.

## Comparison with Non-Cyclic Groups

Not all groups have such a simple subgroup structure.

**Example**: The Klein four-group $V_4$ has 5 subgroups:
- $\{e\}$
- $\{e, a\}$
- $\{e, b\}$
- $\{e, ab\}$
- $V_4$

But $V_4$ has order 4 with divisors 1, 2, 4. There are three subgroups of order 2 (not unique)!

This violates the property from Theorem 3, confirming $V_4$ is not cyclic.

## Summary

The Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups tells us:
1. All cyclic groups are essentially $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}_n$
2. Subgroups correspond exactly to divisors
3. For each divisor $d$ of $n$, there is a unique subgroup of order $d$ in $\mathbb{Z}_n$
4. The subgroup lattice is completely determined by the divisibility lattice of $n$

This complete classification makes cyclic groups the most well-understood class of groups in abstract algebra.
