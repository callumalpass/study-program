# The Alternating Group

## Definition

**Definition**: The **alternating group** $A_n$ is the subgroup of $S_n$ consisting of all even permutations:
$$A_n = \{\sigma \in S_n : \text{sgn}(\sigma) = 1\}$$

$A_n$ is the kernel of the sign homomorphism $\text{sgn}: S_n \to \{-1, +1\}$.

The concept of even and odd permutations arises from the decomposition of permutations into products of transpositions. While such decompositions are not unique, the parity (evenness or oddness) of the number of transpositions is invariant. A permutation is **even** if it can be expressed as a product of an even number of transpositions, and **odd** if it requires an odd number of transpositions.

## Basic Properties

**Theorem 1**: $A_n$ is a normal subgroup of $S_n$ with index 2.

**Proof**: As the kernel of a homomorphism, $A_n \triangleleft S_n$. Since $\text{sgn}$ is surjective, $|S_n : A_n| = 2$. $\square$

**Order**: $|A_n| = n!/2$ for $n \geq 2$.

This follows immediately from the index formula: since $[S_n : A_n] = 2$ and $|S_n| = n!$, we have $|A_n| = n!/2$.

**Generators**: $A_n$ is generated by 3-cycles for $n \geq 3$.

This generating property is remarkable because it shows that despite the large number of elements in $A_n$, the entire group can be built from a specific class of simple permutations. This fact is crucial in proving the simplicity of $A_n$ for $n \geq 5$.

## $A_3$ - The Smallest Alternating Group

$|A_3| = 3!/2 = 3$

**Elements**:
- $\text{id}$
- $(1\,2\,3)$
- $(1\,3\,2)$

**Structure**: $A_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}_3$ (cyclic of order 3)

Since $A_3$ has prime order, it must be cyclic by Lagrange's theorem. Any non-identity element generates the entire group. For example, $(1\,2\,3)$ is a generator since $(1\,2\,3)^2 = (1\,3\,2)$ and $(1\,2\,3)^3 = e$.

**Cayley Table**:
$$\begin{array}{c|ccc}
\circ & e & (123) & (132) \\
\hline
e & e & (123) & (132) \\
(123) & (123) & (132) & e \\
(132) & (132) & e & (123)
\end{array}$$

This table demonstrates the cyclic structure explicitly. Note that $A_3$ is the unique group of order 3 up to isomorphism.

## $A_4$ - The Tetrahedral Group

$|A_4| = 24/2 = 12$

**Elements by cycle type**:
- 1 identity
- 8 3-cycles: $(1\,2\,3), (1\,3\,2), (1\,2\,4), (1\,4\,2), (1\,3\,4), (1\,4\,3), (2\,3\,4), (2\,4\,3)$
- 3 double transpositions: $(1\,2)(3\,4), (1\,3)(2\,4), (1\,4)(2\,3)$

The double transpositions are particularly interesting. Each is an even permutation (being the product of two transpositions) and each has order 2. Together with the identity, they form the Klein four-group.

**Subgroups**:
- Klein four-group: $V_4 = \{e, (1\,2)(3\,4), (1\,3)(2\,4), (1\,4)(2\,3)\}$
- Four cyclic subgroups of order 3 (generated by 3-cycles)
- Total: 10 subgroups

**Non-simplicity**: $A_4$ is not simple since $V_4 \triangleleft A_4$.

**Proof**: We can verify that $V_4$ is normal by checking that it is closed under conjugation. For any $\sigma \in A_4$ and any $\tau \in V_4$, we have $\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1} \in V_4$. This follows because double transpositions are conjugated to double transpositions. $\square$

**Geometric interpretation**: $A_4$ represents the rotation symmetries of a regular tetrahedron. The 3-cycles correspond to 120° rotations about axes through vertices, while the double transpositions represent 180° rotations about axes through edge midpoints.

## $A_5$ - The Icosahedral Group

$|A_5| = 120/2 = 60$

**Elements by cycle type**:
- 1 identity
- 24 5-cycles
- 20 3-cycles
- 15 double transpositions

These counts can be verified using the cycle index formula and the fact that conjugacy in $S_n$ is determined by cycle type.

**Remarkable property**: $A_5$ is **simple** (no nontrivial normal subgroups).

**Proof sketch**: The proof proceeds by examining all possible orders of normal subgroups. By Lagrange's theorem, a proper normal subgroup must have order dividing 60. We systematically check orders 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30 and show that no such normal subgroup exists. The key observation is that any normal subgroup must be a union of conjugacy classes (including the identity), and no such union has the required orders. $\square$

**Implications**:
- Smallest non-abelian simple group
- No solvable series → quintic equations unsolvable by radicals (Galois theory)
- Related to icosahedron and dodecahedron symmetries

The connection to polynomial solvability is profound: the Galois group of the general quintic polynomial is $S_5$, which has $A_5$ as a subgroup. Since $A_5$ is simple and non-abelian, $S_5$ is not solvable, implying there is no general formula for solving quintic equations using radicals.

## Simplicity of $A_n$ for $n \geq 5$

**Theorem**: $A_n$ is simple for all $n \geq 5$.

**Proof outline**:
1. Show $A_n$ is generated by 3-cycles
2. Any normal subgroup containing a 3-cycle contains all 3-cycles
3. Therefore normal subgroups are either $\{e\}$ or $A_n$

**Detailed proof**: Suppose $N \triangleleft A_n$ is a nontrivial normal subgroup. We show $N = A_n$ by proving $N$ contains all 3-cycles.

First, suppose $N$ contains some 3-cycle $\sigma$. For any other 3-cycle $\tau$, we can find $\alpha \in A_n$ such that $\tau = \alpha \sigma \alpha^{-1}$ (all 3-cycles are conjugate in $A_n$ when $n \geq 5$). Since $N$ is normal, $\tau \in N$. Thus if $N$ contains one 3-cycle, it contains all 3-cycles, hence $N = A_n$.

The proof is completed by showing that any nontrivial normal subgroup must contain a 3-cycle. This involves careful case analysis based on the cycle structure of elements in $N$. $\square$

This is a cornerstone result in group theory and forms the basis for understanding the classification of finite simple groups.

## Generators of $A_n$

**Theorem**: $A_n$ is generated by 3-cycles.

**Proof**: Every even permutation is a product of an even number of transpositions. Write:
$$(a\,b)(c\,d) = \begin{cases}
(a\,b\,c) & \text{if } b = c \\
(a\,c\,b)(a\,c\,d) & \text{if } b \neq c
\end{cases}$$

For example: $(1\,2)(2\,3) = (1\,2\,3)$ and $(1\,2)(3\,4) = (1\,3\,2)(1\,3\,4)$.

Thus every even permutation is a product of 3-cycles. $\square$

**Minimal generators**: $A_n = \langle (1\,2\,3), (1\,2\,4), \ldots, (1\,2\,n) \rangle$.

This shows that $A_n$ can be generated by just $n-2$ elements, which is remarkably efficient given that $|A_n| = n!/2$ grows factorially.

## Conjugacy in $A_n$

Conjugacy classes in $A_n$ may split from those in $S_n$. This phenomenon occurs because conjugation in $A_n$ is restricted to even permutations.

**Example**: In $S_3$, the 3-cycles $(1\,2\,3)$ and $(1\,3\,2)$ are conjugate. In $A_3$, they remain in the same conjugacy class.

**Example**: In $S_5$, all 5-cycles form a single conjugacy class of 24 elements. In $A_5$, they split into two classes:
- $(1\,2\,3\,4\,5), (1\,3\,5\,2\,4), \ldots$ (12 elements)
- $(1\,2\,3\,5\,4), (1\,3\,2\,4\,5), \ldots$ (12 elements)

These are related by squaring: the second class consists of squares of elements from the first class.

**Rule**: An $S_n$-conjugacy class splits in $A_n$ if and only if all elements have cycle structure consisting entirely of distinct odd-length cycles.

## Subgroups of $A_n$

**$A_4$ subgroups**:
- $\{e\}$, $A_4$
- $V_4$ (normal, order 4)
- Four cyclic subgroups of order 3
- Three cyclic subgroups of order 2

**$A_5$ subgroups**:
- $\{e\}$, $A_5$
- Copies of $A_4, S_3, \mathbb{Z}_5, \mathbb{Z}_3, \mathbb{Z}_2$
- No normal subgroups besides $\{e\}$ and $A_5$ (simplicity)

The subgroup structure of $A_5$ is particularly rich, containing copies of several important groups while maintaining simplicity.

## Geometric Realizations

**$A_4$**: Rotations of regular tetrahedron (4 vertices, 4 faces, 6 edges)

The correspondence is as follows: 3-cycles correspond to rotations by 120° about vertex-to-opposite-face axes (there are 4 such axes, giving 8 such rotations), and double transpositions correspond to 180° rotations about edge-to-opposite-edge axes (there are 3 such axes).

**$A_5$**: Rotations of icosahedron (12 vertices, 20 faces) or dodecahedron (20 vertices, 12 faces)

The icosahedron and dodecahedron are dual polyhedra, so they have the same rotation group. The 5-cycles correspond to rotations about axes through opposite face centers (for the icosahedron), the 3-cycles to rotations about axes through opposite vertices, and the double transpositions to rotations by 180° about axes through opposite edge midpoints.

These Platonic solids have alternating groups as rotation symmetries, establishing a beautiful connection between group theory and three-dimensional geometry.

## Quotient $S_n / A_n$

Since $[S_n : A_n] = 2$:
$$S_n / A_n \cong \mathbb{Z}_2$$

The quotient distinguishes even from odd permutations. The two cosets are $A_n$ (even permutations) and $(1\,2)A_n$ (odd permutations).

## Applications

**Galois Theory**: Solvability of polynomial equations is determined by the structure of their Galois groups. The fact that $A_5$ is simple proves the unsolvability of the general quintic equation by radicals, resolving a problem that had been open for centuries.

**Rubik's Cube**: The legal positions of a Rubik's Cube (those achievable from the solved state without disassembly) form a group that involves even permutations. The group of the Rubik's Cube is related to $A_8$ (for corner positions) and $A_{12}$ (for edge positions).

**Finite Simple Groups**: The family $\{A_n : n \geq 5\}$ forms one of the infinite families in the classification of finite simple groups. Together with cyclic groups of prime order, the 16 families of groups of Lie type, and the 26 sporadic groups, these constitute all finite simple groups.

## Summary

| $n$ | $|A_n|$ | Structure | Simple? |
|-----|---------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | 1 | Trivial | No |
| 2 | 1 | Trivial | No |
| 3 | 3 | $\mathbb{Z}_3$ | Yes (prime order) |
| 4 | 12 | Tetrahedral | No ($V_4 \triangleleft A_4$) |
| $\geq 5$ | $n!/2$ | Complex | Yes (theorem) |

The alternating group $A_n$ is fundamental in both group theory and Galois theory, serving as a bridge between abstract algebra and classical problems in polynomial equations.
