# Software Design and UML

Software design transforms requirements into architectural and detailed designs that guide implementation. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) provides standardized notation for visualizing, specifying, and documenting software systems, enabling clear communication among stakeholders and developers.

## Overview

Effective software design requires understanding design principles, architectural patterns, and modeling techniques. UML diagrams help developers visualize system structure and behavior before writing code, reducing errors and improving maintainability.

## Key Concepts

### Design Principles
- **SOLID Principles**: Five fundamental object-oriented design principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Dividing systems into distinct features with minimal overlap
- **Design by Contract**: Formal specifications for component behavior
- **Coupling and Cohesion**: Managing dependencies and component focus

### Architectural Patterns
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: Separating data, presentation, and control logic
- **Layered Architecture**: Organizing code into horizontal layers
- **Microservices**: Distributed systems with independent services
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Communication through events and messages

### UML Diagrams
- **Structural Diagrams**: Class, component, deployment, and package diagrams
- **Behavioral Diagrams**: Use case, sequence, activity, and state machine diagrams
- **Interaction Diagrams**: Sequence and communication diagrams

## Learning Objectives

After completing this topic, you should be able to:
- Apply SOLID principles to create maintainable object-oriented designs
- Select appropriate architectural patterns for different system requirements
- Create UML class diagrams showing relationships and multiplicities
- Model system behavior using sequence and state diagrams
- Document software designs effectively for stakeholders and developers
- Evaluate design quality using established principles and metrics
