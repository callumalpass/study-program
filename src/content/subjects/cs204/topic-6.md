# Version Control and CI/CD

Version control systems and continuous integration/deployment practices are fundamental to modern software development. These tools and methodologies enable teams to collaborate effectively, maintain code quality, and deliver software reliably and frequently.

## Overview

Version control tracks changes to code over time, enabling multiple developers to work together without conflicts. CI/CD automates the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring that code changes are validated and delivered quickly and safely.

## Key Concepts

### Version Control Systems
- **Distributed Version Control**: Modern approach where each developer has a complete repository
- **Git**: The dominant version control system used across the industry
- **Branching and Merging**: Techniques for parallel development and integration
- **Collaboration Workflows**: Patterns for team-based development

### Continuous Integration
- **Automated Builds**: Compiling code automatically on every change
- **Automated Testing**: Running test suites to catch issues early
- **Fast Feedback**: Providing rapid feedback to developers
- **Integration Frequency**: Merging changes multiple times per day

### Continuous Deployment
- **Deployment Pipelines**: Automated pathways from code to production
- **Release Automation**: Reducing manual steps in deployment
- **Environment Management**: Handling development, staging, and production
- **Rollback Strategies**: Safely reverting problematic releases
