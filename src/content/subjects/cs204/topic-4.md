# Design Patterns

Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They represent best practices evolved over time by experienced software developers and provide a shared vocabulary for communicating design decisions.

## Overview

Design patterns are not finished code that can be directly copied and pasted into your application. Instead, they are templates that describe how to solve problems in various situations. Understanding and applying design patterns helps create more maintainable, flexible, and scalable software systems.

## Key Concepts

### What Are Design Patterns?

Design patterns provide:
- **Proven Solutions**: Time-tested approaches to recurring design problems
- **Common Vocabulary**: Shared language for discussing design decisions
- **Best Practices**: Encapsulation of expert knowledge and experience
- **Reusability**: Templates that can be adapted to different contexts

### Pattern Categories

Design patterns are typically organized into three main categories:

**Creational Patterns**: Deal with object creation mechanisms
- Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory
- Builder, Prototype

**Structural Patterns**: Handle object composition and relationships
- Adapter, Bridge, Composite
- Decorator, Facade, Proxy

**Behavioral Patterns**: Focus on communication between objects
- Observer, Strategy, Command
- State, Template Method, Iterator

### Pattern Structure

Each pattern typically includes:
- **Intent**: What problem does it solve?
- **Motivation**: Why is this pattern needed?
- **Structure**: Class and object relationships
- **Implementation**: How to implement it
- **Consequences**: Trade-offs and considerations

## Learning Objectives

After completing this topic, you should be able to:
- Recognize common design problems and applicable patterns
- Implement creational, structural, and behavioral patterns
- Evaluate when to use specific patterns
- Avoid anti-patterns and pattern misuse
- Apply architectural patterns to larger system designs
- Understand modern patterns in contemporary software development
