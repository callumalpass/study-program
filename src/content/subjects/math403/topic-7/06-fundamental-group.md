# The Fundamental Group

The fundamental group captures information about loops in a space and is the most important invariant in algebraic topology.

## Definition

**Definition:** A **path** in X from $x_0$ to $x_1$ is a continuous map $\gamma: [0,1] \to X$ with $\gamma(0) = x_0$ and $\gamma(1) = x_1$.

**Definition:** A **loop** based at $x_0$ is a path from $x_0$ to $x_0$.

**Definition:** Paths $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$ are **path homotopic** (relative to endpoints) if there exists $H: [0,1] \times [0,1] \to X$ with:
- $H(s, 0) = \gamma_0(s)$
- $H(s, 1) = \gamma_1(s)$
- $H(0, t) = x_0$ and $H(1, t) = x_1$ for all t

**Definition:** The **fundamental group** $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ is the set of path homotopy classes of loops based at $x_0$.

## Group Structure

**Concatenation:** For loops $\gamma$ and $\delta$:
$$(\gamma \cdot \delta)(s) = \begin{cases} \gamma(2s) & 0 \leq s \leq 1/2 \\ \delta(2s-1) & 1/2 \leq s \leq 1 \end{cases}$$

**Theorem:** Path concatenation induces a well-defined group operation on $\pi_1(X, x_0)$.

**Identity:** The constant loop $c(s) = x_0$.

**Inverse:** $\gamma^{-1}(s) = \gamma(1-s)$ (reverse the loop).

## Simply Connected Spaces

**Definition:** X is **simply connected** if it is path-connected and $\pi_1(X, x_0) = \{e\}$.

**Examples of simply connected spaces:**
- $\mathbb{R}^n$
- $S^n$ for $n \geq 2$
- Convex subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$

**Non-examples:**
- $S^1$ (not simply connected)
- Torus $T^2$ (not simply connected)
- $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{0\}$ (not simply connected)

## Computing Fundamental Groups

### $\pi_1(S^1) \cong \mathbb{Z}$

The fundamental group of the circle is generated by the loop going around once.

*Proof sketch:* Use the covering map $p: \mathbb{R} \to S^1$, $p(t) = e^{2\pi i t}$. Loops lift to paths in $\mathbb{R}$, and the homotopy class is determined by the winding number.

### $\pi_1(T^2) \cong \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$

The torus has two independent loops (around the hole and through the hole).

### $\pi_1(\mathbb{RP}^2) \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$

Real projective plane has a loop that becomes trivial when traversed twice.

## The Fundamental Group and Covering Spaces

**Theorem:** For a covering map $p: \tilde{X} \to X$:
$$p_*: \pi_1(\tilde{X}, \tilde{x}_0) \to \pi_1(X, x_0)$$
is injective, and its image corresponds to the deck transformations.

**Theorem:** The universal cover (simply connected cover) corresponds to the trivial subgroup.

## Induced Homomorphisms

**Theorem:** A continuous map $f: (X, x_0) \to (Y, y_0)$ induces a group homomorphism:
$$f_*: \pi_1(X, x_0) \to \pi_1(Y, y_0)$$
by $f_*([\gamma]) = [f \circ \gamma]$.

**Properties:**
- $(g \circ f)_* = g_* \circ f_*$
- $(id_X)_* = id_{\pi_1}$
- Homotopic maps induce the same homomorphism

## Van Kampen's Theorem

**Theorem (Seifert-van Kampen):** If $X = U \cup V$ with $U, V$ open and $U \cap V$ path-connected:
$$\pi_1(X) \cong \pi_1(U) *_{\pi_1(U \cap V)} \pi_1(V)$$

(amalgamated free product)

**Application:** $\pi_1(S^1 \vee S^1) \cong \mathbb{Z} * \mathbb{Z}$ (free group on two generators).
