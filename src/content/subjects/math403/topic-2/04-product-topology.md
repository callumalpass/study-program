# Product Topology

## Introduction

Given two topological spaces $X$ and $Y$, we can form their Cartesian product $X \times Y = \{(x, y) : x \in X, y \in Y\}$. The **product topology** is the natural topology on this product that makes the projection maps continuous and satisfies important universal properties. This construction extends to arbitrary (even infinite) products and is fundamental in topology.

## Product Topology on Two Spaces

**Definition 4.1 (Product Topology - Two Factors):** Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces. The **product topology** on $X \times Y$ is the topology generated by the basis:
$$\mathcal{B} = \{U \times V : U \in \mathcal{T}_X, V \in \mathcal{T}_Y\}$$

A subset $W \subseteq X \times Y$ is open in the product topology if and only if for every $(x, y) \in W$, there exist $U \in \mathcal{T}_X$ and $V \in \mathcal{T}_Y$ such that $(x, y) \in U \times V \subseteq W$.

**Verification that $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis:**

- **B1:** $X \times Y = X \times Y \in \mathcal{B}$, so $\bigcup_{B \in \mathcal{B}} B = X \times Y$.

- **B2:** Let $(U_1 \times V_1), (U_2 \times V_2) \in \mathcal{B}$. Then:
  $$(U_1 \times V_1) \cap (U_2 \times V_2) = (U_1 \cap U_2) \times (V_1 \cap V_2)$$
  Since $U_1 \cap U_2 \in \mathcal{T}_X$ and $V_1 \cap V_2 \in \mathcal{T}_Y$, the intersection is in $\mathcal{B}$.

Therefore $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis.

### Examples

**Example 4.1:** For $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} = \mathbb{R}^2$ with the standard topologies:

The basis consists of all sets $(a, b) \times (c, d)$ (open rectangles). This generates the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}^2$ - the metric topology from the Euclidean metric.

Open sets in $\mathbb{R}^2$ include:
- Open rectangles $(a, b) \times (c, d)$
- Open disks $\{(x, y) : (x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2 < r^2\}$ (unions of rectangles)
- Any union of open rectangles

**Example 4.2:** Let $X = \{a, b\}$ with topology $\mathcal{T}_X = \{\emptyset, \{a\}, X\}$ and $Y = \{1, 2, 3\}$ with the discrete topology.

The basis for $X \times Y$ consists of:
- $\emptyset \times V = \emptyset$ for any $V$
- $\{a\} \times \{1\} = \{(a, 1)\}$
- $\{a\} \times \{2\} = \{(a, 2)\}$
- $\{a\} \times \{3\} = \{(a, 3)\}$
- $\{a\} \times \{1, 2\} = \{(a, 1), (a, 2)\}$
- ... (all $U \times V$ for $U \in \mathcal{T}_X$, $V \subseteq Y$)
- $X \times Y$

**Example 4.3:** The cylinder $S^1 \times [0, 1]$ where $S^1$ has the subspace topology from $\mathbb{R}^2$.

Open sets are "strips" wrapping around the cylinder.

## Projection Maps

**Definition 4.2 (Projection Maps):** For $X \times Y$, the **projection maps** are:
$$\pi_X: X \times Y \to X, \quad \pi_X(x, y) = x$$
$$\pi_Y: X \times Y \to Y, \quad \pi_Y(x, y) = y$$

**Theorem 4.1 (Projections are Continuous):** The projection maps $\pi_X$ and $\pi_Y$ are continuous.

**Proof:** We show $\pi_X$ is continuous; the proof for $\pi_Y$ is similar.

Let $U \in \mathcal{T}_X$ be open in $X$. Then:
$$\pi_X^{-1}(U) = \{(x, y) \in X \times Y : x \in U\} = U \times Y$$

Since $U \in \mathcal{T}_X$ and $Y \in \mathcal{T}_Y$, we have $U \times Y \in \mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{X \times Y}$. Therefore $\pi_X^{-1}(U)$ is open, showing $\pi_X$ is continuous. $\square$

## Subbasis for Product Topology

**Theorem 4.2 (Subbasis for Product):** The collection:
$$\mathcal{S} = \{\pi_X^{-1}(U) : U \in \mathcal{T}_X\} \cup \{\pi_Y^{-1}(V) : V \in \mathcal{T}_Y\}$$

is a subbasis for the product topology. Equivalently:
$$\mathcal{S} = \{U \times Y : U \in \mathcal{T}_X\} \cup \{X \times V : V \in \mathcal{T}_Y\}$$

**Proof:** Finite intersections of elements of $\mathcal{S}$ give:
$$(U_1 \times Y) \cap (U_2 \times Y) = (U_1 \cap U_2) \times Y$$
$$(X \times V_1) \cap (X \times V_2) = X \times (V_1 \cap V_2)$$
$$(U \times Y) \cap (X \times V) = U \times V$$

The collection of all finite intersections is:
$$\{U \times V : U \in \mathcal{T}_X, V \in \mathcal{T}_Y\} \cup \{U \times Y : U \in \mathcal{T}_X\} \cup \{X \times V : V \in \mathcal{T}_Y\} \cup \{X \times Y\}$$

This contains the basis $\mathcal{B} = \{U \times V : U \in \mathcal{T}_X, V \in \mathcal{T}_Y\}$, so it generates the product topology. $\square$

## Universal Property

The product topology has an important universal property that characterizes it uniquely.

**Theorem 4.3 (Universal Property of Product):** Let $Z$ be a topological space and $f: Z \to X \times Y$ be a function. Then $f$ is continuous if and only if both $\pi_X \circ f: Z \to X$ and $\pi_Y \circ f: Z \to Y$ are continuous.

**Proof:**

($\Rightarrow$) If $f$ is continuous, then $\pi_X \circ f$ and $\pi_Y \circ f$ are compositions of continuous functions, hence continuous.

($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $\pi_X \circ f$ and $\pi_Y \circ f$ are continuous. To show $f$ is continuous, it suffices to show that $f^{-1}(B)$ is open for every basis element $B$.

Let $B = U \times V \in \mathcal{B}$. Then:
$$f^{-1}(U \times V) = \{z \in Z : f(z) \in U \times V\} = \{z : \pi_X(f(z)) \in U \text{ and } \pi_Y(f(z)) \in V\}$$
$$= \{z : (\pi_X \circ f)(z) \in U\} \cap \{z : (\pi_Y \circ f)(z) \in V\} = (\pi_X \circ f)^{-1}(U) \cap (\pi_Y \circ f)^{-1}(V)$$

Since $\pi_X \circ f$ and $\pi_Y \circ f$ are continuous, both $(\pi_X \circ f)^{-1}(U)$ and $(\pi_Y \circ f)^{-1}(V)$ are open in $Z$. Their intersection is open, so $f^{-1}(U \times V)$ is open.

Therefore $f$ is continuous. $\square$

**Corollary 4.1:** The product topology is the coarsest topology on $X \times Y$ making both projection maps continuous.

**Proof:** If $\mathcal{T}$ is any topology on $X \times Y$ making $\pi_X$ and $\pi_Y$ continuous, then for any $U \in \mathcal{T}_X$ and $V \in \mathcal{T}_Y$:
$$U \times V = \pi_X^{-1}(U) \cap \pi_Y^{-1}(V) \in \mathcal{T}$$

Therefore $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$, so $\mathcal{T}_{X \times Y} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$. $\square$

## Finite Products

The product topology extends naturally to finite products.

**Definition 4.3 (Finite Product Topology):** For topological spaces $X_1, \ldots, X_n$, the product topology on $\prod_{i=1}^n X_i = X_1 \times \cdots \times X_n$ has basis:
$$\mathcal{B} = \left\{\prod_{i=1}^n U_i : U_i \in \mathcal{T}_{X_i}\right\}$$

**Example 4.4:** $\mathbb{R}^3 = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ with the product topology has basis consisting of all "boxes" $(a_1, b_1) \times (a_2, b_2) \times (a_3, b_3)$.

This coincides with the metric topology from the Euclidean metric.

**Theorem 4.4:** For finite products, the product topology on $\prod_{i=1}^n X_i$ is the coarsest topology making all projection maps $\pi_i: \prod_{j=1}^n X_j \to X_i$ continuous.

## Infinite Products

For infinite products, the definition requires care.

**Definition 4.4 (Infinite Product Topology):** Let $\{X_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in I}$ be a family of topological spaces indexed by a set $I$ (possibly infinite). The **product topology** on $\prod_{\alpha \in I} X_\alpha$ is generated by the subbasis:
$$\mathcal{S} = \left\{\pi_\alpha^{-1}(U) : \alpha \in I, U \in \mathcal{T}_{X_\alpha}\right\}$$

where $\pi_\alpha: \prod_{\beta \in I} X_\beta \to X_\alpha$ is the projection onto the $\alpha$-th factor.

**Equivalently:** A basis for the product topology consists of all sets of the form:
$$\prod_{\alpha \in I} U_\alpha$$

where $U_\alpha \in \mathcal{T}_{X_\alpha}$ for all $\alpha$, and $U_\alpha = X_\alpha$ for all but finitely many $\alpha$.

**Important:** In infinite products, basis elements have the form $\prod_\alpha U_\alpha$ where only finitely many $U_\alpha$ are proper subsets of $X_\alpha$ - the rest must be the whole space $X_\alpha$.

**Example 4.5:** Consider $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N} = \prod_{n=1}^\infty \mathbb{R}$ (infinite sequences of real numbers).

A basis element has the form:
$$U = \{(x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots) : x_1 \in (a_1, b_1), x_2 \in (a_2, b_2), \ldots, x_n \in (a_n, b_n), x_{n+1} \in \mathbb{R}, x_{n+2} \in \mathbb{R}, \ldots\}$$

for some finite $n$. This restricts only finitely many coordinates.

**Example 4.6:** The Hilbert cube $H = \prod_{n=1}^\infty [0, 1/n]$ with the product topology.

A basis element looks like:
$$U = \{(x_1, x_2, \ldots) : x_1 \in (a_1, b_1) \cap [0, 1], \ldots, x_n \in (a_n, b_n) \cap [0, 1/n], x_{n+1} \in [0, 1/(n+1)], \ldots\}$$

## Why Not All Coordinates?

**Question:** Why don't we allow basis elements where infinitely many coordinates are restricted?

**Answer:** If we did, the resulting topology (called the **box topology**) would be too fine and fail to have nice properties like:
- Tychonoff's theorem (products of compact spaces are compact) would fail
- The universal property would fail
- The product would not be the categorical product in the category of topological spaces

The product topology is carefully designed to make projections continuous and preserve compactness.

## Properties of Product Topology

**Theorem 4.5 (Closure in Products):** If $A \subseteq X$ and $B \subseteq Y$, then:
$$\overline{A \times B} = \overline{A} \times \overline{B}$$

in the product topology on $X \times Y$.

**Proof:**

($\subseteq$) Let $(x, y) \in \overline{A \times B}$. We show $x \in \overline{A}$ and $y \in \overline{B}$.

Let $U$ be an open set in $X$ containing $x$. Then $U \times Y$ is open in $X \times Y$ and contains $(x, y)$. Since $(x, y) \in \overline{A \times B}$, we have $(U \times Y) \cap (A \times B) \neq \emptyset$. Thus there exist $a \in U \cap A$ and $b \in B$. So $U \cap A \neq \emptyset$, showing $x \in \overline{A}$. Similarly, $y \in \overline{B}$.

($\supseteq$) Let $(x, y) \in \overline{A} \times \overline{B}$. We show $(x, y) \in \overline{A \times B}$.

Let $W$ be an open set in $X \times Y$ containing $(x, y)$. There exists a basis element $U \times V$ with $(x, y) \in U \times V \subseteq W$. Since $x \in \overline{A}$, we have $U \cap A \neq \emptyset$. Since $y \in \overline{B}$, we have $V \cap B \neq \emptyset$. Therefore:
$$(U \times V) \cap (A \times B) = (U \cap A) \times (V \cap B) \neq \emptyset$$

Thus $W \cap (A \times B) \neq \emptyset$, showing $(x, y) \in \overline{A \times B}$. $\square$

**Theorem 4.6 (Connectedness):** If $X$ and $Y$ are connected, then $X \times Y$ is connected.

We'll prove this when we study connectedness.

**Theorem 4.7 (Compactness - Tychonoff):** If $X$ and $Y$ are compact, then $X \times Y$ is compact. More generally, arbitrary products of compact spaces are compact in the product topology.

This is Tychonoff's theorem, one of the most important theorems in topology.

## Summary

Key points about product topology:

1. **Basis:** $\{U \times V : U \in \mathcal{T}_X, V \in \mathcal{T}_Y\}$ for two factors
2. **Subbasis:** $\{U \times Y, X \times V\}$ (projections of open sets)
3. **Projections continuous:** Defining property of product topology
4. **Universal property:** $f: Z \to X \times Y$ continuous iff $\pi_X \circ f$ and $\pi_Y \circ f$ continuous
5. **Infinite products:** Only finitely many coordinates restricted in basis elements
6. **Preserves properties:** Closure, connectedness, compactness

The product topology is fundamental for constructing new spaces and is the categorical product in the category of topological spaces.
