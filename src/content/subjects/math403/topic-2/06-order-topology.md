# Order Topology

## Introduction

Many topological spaces arise naturally from order structures. The **order topology** provides a canonical way to turn any linearly ordered set into a topological space. This topology captures the intuitive notion of "nearness" based on the ordering, generalizing the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$.

## Linear Orders

**Definition 6.1 (Linear Order):** A **linear order** (or **total order**) on a set $X$ is a relation $<$ satisfying:
1. **Trichotomy:** For all $x, y \in X$, exactly one of $x < y$, $x = y$, or $y < x$ holds
2. **Transitivity:** If $x < y$ and $y < z$, then $x < z$

We write $x \leq y$ to mean $x < y$ or $x = y$.

**Example 6.1:**
- $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual order $<$
- $\mathbb{Z}$ with the usual order
- $\mathbb{Q}$ with the usual order
- $[0, 1]$ with the order inherited from $\mathbb{R}$
- Any finite set with a specified ordering

## Definition of Order Topology

**Definition 6.2 (Order Topology):** Let $(X, <)$ be a linearly ordered set. The **order topology** on $X$ is generated by the subbasis:
$$\mathcal{S} = \{(a, \infty) : a \in X\} \cup \{(-\infty, b) : b \in X\}$$

where:
- $(a, \infty) = \{x \in X : x > a\}$ (ray to the right)
- $(-\infty, b) = \{x \in X : x < b\}$ (ray to the left)

**Basis for Order Topology:** Finite intersections of subbasis elements give:

1. **Open intervals:** $(a, b) = (a, \infty) \cap (-\infty, b) = \{x : a < x < b\}$ for $a, b \in X$ with $a < b$
2. **Rays:** $(a, \infty)$ and $(-\infty, b)$
3. **Whole space:** $X$ (empty intersection)

If $X$ has a smallest element $\min X$ or largest element $\max X$, we also have:
- $[\min X, b) = X \cap (-\infty, b)$ for $b > \min X$
- $(a, \max X] = X \cap (a, \infty)$ for $a < \max X$

**Definition 6.3 (Standard Basis for Order Topology):** The **standard basis** for the order topology on a linearly ordered set $X$ consists of:
- All open intervals $(a, b)$
- All rays $(a, \infty)$ and $(-\infty, b)$
- If $X$ has endpoints, all half-open intervals $[\min X, b)$ and $(a, \max X]$

## Examples

**Example 6.2 ($\mathbb{R}$ with Usual Order):**

The order topology on $\mathbb{R}$ is the standard topology.

Basis: All open intervals $(a, b)$ and rays.

Open sets: All unions of open intervals (the familiar open sets of real analysis).

**Example 6.3 ($\mathbb{Z}$ with Usual Order):**

For integers, every open interval $(n, m)$ where $n, m \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $n < m$ contains finitely many integers (possibly none if $m = n + 1$).

In fact: For $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, the open interval $(n-1, n+1) = \{n\}$.

Therefore $\{n\}$ is open for every $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. The order topology on $\mathbb{Z}$ is the discrete topology.

**Example 6.4 (Well-Ordered Sets):**

Let $X = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, \omega\}$ where $\omega$ is "the first infinite ordinal" (think of it as coming "after" all natural numbers), with order $0 < 1 < 2 < \cdots < \omega$.

Open sets include:
- $(n, \omega) = \{n+1, n+2, \ldots, \omega\}$ for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$
- $(n, m)$ for $n < m$ (finite intervals)
- $(-\infty, \omega) = \mathbb{N}$ (all natural numbers)

Is $\{\omega\}$ open? We need to find basis element containing only $\omega$. The smallest open interval containing $\omega$ would be $(n, \omega]$ for some $n$, but $(n, \omega]$ is not an open interval (it's half-open). There's no $(a, b)$ with $\omega \in (a, b) \subseteq \{\omega\}$.

However, $\{\omega\}$ is closed: Its complement is $\mathbb{N} = (-\infty, \omega)$, which is open.

**Example 6.5 (Ordered Square):**

Define the **lexicographic order** on $[0, 1] \times [0, 1]$:
$$(x_1, y_1) < (x_2, y_2) \iff x_1 < x_2 \text{ or } (x_1 = x_2 \text{ and } y_1 < y_2)$$

This is like dictionary ordering: first compare first coordinates, then second coordinates if needed.

In the order topology:
- The "vertical" segment $\{1/2\} \times (0, 1)$ is open: it equals the open interval $((1/2, 0), (1/2, 1))$ in the lexicographic order
- This is different from the product topology on $[0, 1] \times [0, 1]$, where vertical segments are not open

## Properties of Order Topology

**Theorem 6.1:** In the order topology on a linearly ordered set $X$:

1. Every open interval $(a, b)$ is open
2. If $X$ has no smallest element, every ray $(-\infty, b)$ is open
3. If $X$ has no largest element, every ray $(a, \infty)$ is open
4. The order topology is the coarsest topology making the order relation "continuous" in a certain sense

**Proof:** (1)-(3) follow from the definition of the basis. (4) is more subtle and involves the notion of order-preserving maps. $\square$

**Theorem 6.2 (Hausdorff Property):** Every linearly ordered set with the order topology is Hausdorff.

**Proof:** Let $x, y \in X$ with $x \neq y$. By trichotomy, assume $x < y$.

**Case 1:** There exists $z \in X$ with $x < z < y$.
Then $U = (-\infty, z)$ and $V = (z, \infty)$ are disjoint open sets with $x \in U$ and $y \in V$.

**Case 2:** There is no $z$ with $x < z < y$ (i.e., $y$ is the immediate successor of $x$).
Then $U = (-\infty, y)$ and $V = (x, \infty)$ are disjoint open sets with $x \in U$ and $y \in V$. $\square$

This shows order topologies are always Hausdorff (a strong separation property we'll study later).

**Theorem 6.3 (Connectedness):** An ordered set $X$ with the order topology is connected if and only if:
1. $X$ is a linear continuum (for any $x < y$, there exists $z$ with $x < z < y$)
2. $X$ has no "gaps" (if $A, B \subseteq X$ with $A < B$ meaning $a < b$ for all $a \in A, b \in B$, then there exists $c \in X$ with $A \leq c \leq B$)

We'll prove this when studying connectedness. The key example: $\mathbb{R}$ is connected, but $\mathbb{Q}$ is not (it has gaps like $\{\sqrt{2}\}$).

## Order-Preserving Functions

**Definition 6.4 (Order-Preserving):** A function $f: (X, <_X) \to (Y, <_Y)$ between ordered sets is **order-preserving** (or **monotone increasing**) if:
$$x_1 <_X x_2 \implies f(x_1) <_Y f(x_2)$$

**Theorem 6.4:** If $f: X \to Y$ is order-preserving and surjective, and both $X$ and $Y$ have the order topology, then $f$ is continuous.

**Proof:** We show $f^{-1}(U)$ is open for every basis element $U$ in $Y$.

**Case 1:** $U = (a, b)$ in $Y$.
Then:
$$f^{-1}((a, b)) = \{x \in X : a < f(x) < b\}$$

This is a union of open intervals in $X$, hence open.

**Case 2:** $U = (a, \infty)$ in $Y$.
Then $f^{-1}((a, \infty)) = \{x : f(x) > a\}$, which is a ray or union of rays in $X$, hence open.

Similarly for other basis elements. $\square$

**Example 6.6:** The function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ given by $f(x) = x^3$ is order-preserving (since $x < y \implies x^3 < y^3$) and continuous in the order topology.

## Subspace of Order Topology

**Theorem 6.5:** If $Y \subseteq X$ where $X$ has the order topology, the subspace topology on $Y$ may differ from the order topology on $Y$ (with the induced order).

**Example 6.7:** Let $Y = [0, 1] \cup [2, 3] \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

**Subspace topology on $Y$:** $[0, 1]$ is clopen (both open and closed) in $Y$ because:
- $[0, 1] = (-1, 1.5) \cap Y$ (open in subspace topology)
- $[0, 1]$ is also closed (its complement in $Y$ is $[2, 3]$, which is open)

**Order topology on $Y$:** The open intervals in $Y$ are $(a, b) \cap Y$ for $a, b \in Y$. These don't make $[0, 1]$ open in the order topology on $Y$ alone.

However, in this case, the topologies coincide. The key point is that the subspace topology from the order topology on $X$ equals the order topology on $Y$ when $Y$ is **convex** in $X$.

**Definition 6.5 (Convex):** $Y \subseteq X$ is **convex** if whenever $a, b \in Y$ with $a < b$, all $x \in X$ with $a < x < b$ are also in $Y$.

**Theorem 6.6:** If $Y \subseteq X$ is convex, the subspace topology on $Y$ inherited from the order topology on $X$ equals the order topology on $Y$.

## Comparing Order Topology with Other Topologies

**Example 6.8 (Lower Limit Topology):**

On $\mathbb{R}$, the lower limit topology (with basis $\{[a, b) : a < b\}$) is strictly finer than the order topology.

The order topology is generated by open intervals $(a, b)$, while the lower limit topology is generated by half-open intervals $[a, b)$.

Every open interval $(a, b)$ can be written as $\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty [a + 1/n, b)$, so order topology open sets are lower limit open. But $[0, 1)$ is lower limit open but not order topology open.

**Example 6.9 (Discrete Topology):**

For any finite linearly ordered set, the order topology is discrete.

For infinite discrete sets (like $\mathbb{Z}$), the order topology is also discrete if the order is the usual one.

## Long Line and Other Exotic Examples

**Example 6.10 (The Long Line):**

The **long line** $L$ is constructed by taking uncountably many copies of $[0, 1)$ and gluing them end-to-end in a well-ordered manner. It has the order topology.

Properties:
- Connected (no gaps)
- Non-compact (even though each $[0, 1)$ segment is compact)
- Not metrizable
- Locally homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$

This is an exotic example showing order topologies can create unusual spaces.

## Applications

Order topologies appear in:

1. **Real analysis:** $\mathbb{R}$ with the standard topology
2. **Ordinal spaces:** Well-ordered sets and ordinal arithmetic
3. **Lattice theory:** Topology on partially ordered sets
4. **Interval analysis:** Topologies on intervals in partially ordered spaces

## Summary

Key points about order topology:

1. **Subbasis:** Rays $(a, \infty)$ and $(-\infty, b)$
2. **Basis:** Open intervals $(a, b)$, rays, and possibly half-open intervals at endpoints
3. **Hausdorff:** Always satisfied
4. **Examples:** $\mathbb{R}$ (standard topology), $\mathbb{Z}$ (discrete), lexicographic squares
5. **Connectedness:** Requires no gaps in the order
6. **Order-preserving maps:** Automatically continuous

The order topology provides a natural topology on any linearly ordered set, generalizing our intuition from the real numbers.
