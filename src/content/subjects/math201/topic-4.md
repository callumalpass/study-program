# Topic 4: Linear Independence and Basis

## Overview

Linear independence and basis are fundamental concepts in linear algebra that provide the foundation for understanding vector spaces. This topic explores how vectors relate to each other, what it means for a set of vectors to span a space efficiently, and how we can characterize vector spaces through their dimension.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this topic, you should be able to:

- Determine whether a set of vectors is linearly independent or dependent
- Find and verify bases for vector spaces
- Calculate the dimension of a vector space
- Compute the rank of a matrix and understand its significance
- Find bases for null spaces, column spaces, and row spaces
- Apply basis concepts to real-world problems

## Key Concepts

### Linear Independence

A set of vectors is linearly independent if no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others. This is a crucial property that ensures each vector contributes unique information to the space.

### Basis

A basis is a linearly independent set of vectors that spans the entire vector space. It represents the minimal set of vectors needed to generate all vectors in the space.

### Dimension

The dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in any basis for that space. This fundamental invariant characterizes the "size" of the vector space.

### Rank

The rank of a matrix reveals the dimension of its column space and provides crucial information about the solutions to linear systems.
