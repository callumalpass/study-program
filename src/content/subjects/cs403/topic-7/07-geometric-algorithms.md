# Advanced Geometric Algorithms

## Point in Polygon
**Ray casting**: Count intersections with ray from point.

**Time**: $O(n)$

## Convex Hull in 3D
**Incremental**: Add points one by one.

**Time**: $O(n \log n)$ expected

## Conclusion
Computational geometry algorithms enable spatial data processing across graphics, GIS, robotics, and more. Key techniques: sweep line, divide-and-conquer, space partitioning.
