# Karger's Min-Cut Algorithm: Contraction and Success Probability

## Introduction

The minimum cut problem asks for the minimum number of edges whose removal disconnects a graph. Karger's randomized contraction algorithm (1993) is remarkably simple yet achieves polynomial expected running time.

This algorithm exemplifies how randomization can lead to elegant solutions for problems where deterministic algorithms are complex.

## Minimum Cut Problem

**Input**: Undirected graph $G = (V, E)$

**Output**: Partition of vertices $(S, V\setminus S)$ minimizing edges crossing the cut

**Min-cut value**: $|\{(u,v) \in E : u \in S, v \in V\setminus S\}|$

### Example

    style B fill:#a8e6cf
    style C fill:#ffe6e6
    style D fill:#ffe6e6
```

Min-cut: Separate {1,2} from {3,4}, cutting 2 edges.

## Karger's Algorithm

**Idea**: Randomly contract edges until 2 vertices remain.

**Edge contraction**: Merge endpoints, remove self-loops.

```typescript
function kargerMinCut(G: Graph): number {
    let H = G.clone();
    
    while (H.vertexCount() > 2) {
        // Choose random edge uniformly
        const edge = H.randomEdge();
        
        // Contract edge
        H = H.contract(edge);
    }
    
    // Return number of edges between final 2 super-vertices
    return H.edgeCount();
}

class Graph {
    contract(edge: Edge): Graph {
        const [u, v] = edge;
        const newGraph = this.clone();
        
        // Merge v into u
        for (const neighbor of newGraph.neighbors(v)) {
            if (neighbor !== u) {
                newGraph.addEdge(u, neighbor);
            }
        }
        
        newGraph.removeVertex(v);
        return newGraph;
    }
}
```

**Time**: $O(n^2)$ per run.

## Analysis

**Theorem**: Algorithm finds min-cut with probability $\geq \frac{2}{n(n-1)}$.

**Proof**:

Let $C$ = min-cut with $k$ edges.

**Goal**: Show $\Pr[\text{no edge of } C \text{ contracted}] \geq \frac{2}{n(n-1)}$.

**Observation 1**: Every vertex has degree $\geq k$ (otherwise cutting edges incident to low-degree vertex gives smaller cut).

**Therefore**: $|E| \geq \frac{nk}{2}$

**Iteration 1**: 
$$\Pr[\text{avoid } C] = 1 - \frac{k}{|E|} \geq 1 - \frac{k}{nk/2} = 1 - \frac{2}{n}$$

**After iteration 1**: $n-1$ vertices, min-cut still $\geq k$.

**Iteration 2**:
$$\Pr[\text{avoid } C | \text{avoided in iteration 1}] \geq 1 - \frac{2}{n-1}$$

**General**: After $i$ contractions, $n-i$ vertices remain.
$$\Pr[\text{avoid } C \text{ in iteration } i+1] \geq 1 - \frac{2}{n-i}$$

**Overall**:
$$\begin{align}
\Pr[\text{success}] &= \prod_{i=0}^{n-3} \left(1 - \frac{2}{n-i}\right) \\
&= \prod_{i=0}^{n-3} \frac{n-i-2}{n-i} \\
&= \frac{n-2}{n} \cdot \frac{n-3}{n-1} \cdot \frac{n-4}{n-2} \cdots \frac{2}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \\
&= \frac{2 \cdot 1}{n(n-1)} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}
\end{align}$$

Therefore, success probability is $\Omega(1/n^2)$. ✓

## Amplification

**Repeat** $N = \binom{n}{2} \ln n = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \ln n$ times, return minimum cut found.

**Probability of failure**:
$$\Pr[\text{all runs fail}] = \left(1 - \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\right)^{N}$$

Using $1-x \leq e^{-x}$:
$$\leq e^{-\frac{2N}{n(n-1)}} = e^{-\ln n} = \frac{1}{n}$$

**Therefore**: With $O(n^2 \log n)$ runs (total time $O(n^4 \log n)$), find min-cut with high probability.

## Faster Version: Karger-Stein

**Idea**: Use recursive calls and early stopping.

```typescript
function kargerStein(G: Graph): number {
    if (G.vertexCount() <= 6) {
        return bruteForceMinCut(G);
    }
    
    const t = Math.ceil(1 + G.vertexCount() / Math.sqrt(2));
    
    // Contract to t vertices twice
    const G1 = contractTo(G, t);
    const G2 = contractTo(G, t);
    
    // Recurse
    const cut1 = kargerStein(G1);
    const cut2 = kargerStein(G2);
    
    return Math.min(cut1, cut2);
}
```

**Time**: $O(n^2 \log n)$ per run (faster than basic version)

**Runs needed**: $O(\log n)$ for high probability

**Total time**: $O(n^2 \log^3 n)$ with high probability

## Deterministic Min-Cut

**Stoer-Wagner algorithm** (1997): Deterministic $O(mn + n^2 \log n)$ time.

**Comparison**:
- Karger: Simple, randomized, $O(n^2 \log^3 n)$
- Stoer-Wagner: Complex, deterministic, $O(mn + n^2 \log n)$

**For dense graphs** ($m = \Theta(n^2)$): Similar performance.

## Applications

**Network reliability**: Minimum edge set whose failure disconnects network

**Image segmentation**: Partition image into regions (min-cut on pixel graph)

**Community detection**: Find natural partitions in social networks

## Why Randomization Helps

The power of Karger's algorithm comes from a key insight: while any single run has low success probability ($\Omega(1/n^2)$), we can boost confidence through repetition.

**Observation**: Each run is independent. If we run the algorithm $t$ times:
$$\Pr[\text{all runs fail}] = (1 - 1/n^2)^t \leq e^{-t/n^2}$$

Setting $t = n^2 \ln n$ makes failure probability $\leq 1/n$.

**Key tradeoff**: Simple algorithm with many runs vs complex algorithm with single run.

## Counting Minimum Cuts

An interesting consequence: a graph has at most $\binom{n}{2}$ minimum cuts.

**Proof**: Each minimum cut has probability $\geq 2/n(n-1)$ of being found by one run. Since probabilities of finding distinct cuts are disjoint events:
$$\text{(number of min cuts)} \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \leq 1$$

Therefore at most $\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = \binom{n}{2}$ minimum cuts exist.

This bound is tight: a cycle graph has exactly $\binom{n}{2}$ minimum cuts (each pair of edges).

## Parallel Implementation

Karger's algorithm parallelizes well:

- Run many independent copies simultaneously
- Each processor needs only a copy of the graph
- No synchronization needed until final comparison

This makes it attractive for distributed computing environments where simple, parallelizable algorithms are preferred over complex sequential ones.

## Conclusion

Karger's algorithm showcases randomization at its best:
- Extremely simple algorithm (few lines of code)
- Non-obvious correctness proof
- Amplification gives high-probability guarantee
- Competitive with complex deterministic algorithms

The analysis techniques (probability over random choices, product of survival probabilities) appear throughout randomized algorithms. The algorithm also demonstrates how randomization can yield structural insights—like the bound on number of minimum cuts.
