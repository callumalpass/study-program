# Game Playing History

## Chess: Deep Blue
**1997**: IBM Deep Blue defeats Kasparov
- Specialized hardware
- 200M positions/second
- Alpha-beta + evaluation function
- Opening book + endgame tables

## Checkers: Chinook
**1994**: Chinook defeats human champion
**2007**: Checkers "solved" - proven draw with perfect play
- Complete endgame database
- 39 trillion positions

## Go: AlphaGo
**2016**: AlphaGo defeats Lee Sedol 4-1
- Deep neural networks for evaluation
- MCTS for search
- Trained on expert games + self-play
**2017**: AlphaGo Zero learns from scratch, defeats AlphaGo 100-0
- No human knowledge
- Pure self-play reinforcement learning

## Poker: Libratus & Pluribus
**2017**: Libratus defeats top poker pros (heads-up)
**2019**: Pluribus wins at 6-player poker
- Imperfect information handling
- Abstraction techniques
- Nash equilibrium approximation

## Conclusion
Game playing milestones drove AI research: search algorithms, evaluation functions, machine learning integration.
