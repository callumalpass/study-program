# Heuristic Design

## Introduction

The effectiveness of informed search depends critically on heuristic quality. This exploration examines systematic techniques for designing admissible heuristics: relaxed problems, pattern databases, landmarks, and combining heuristics.

## Conclusion

Effective heuristics make the difference between tractable and intractable problems. Systematic design techniques—relaxed problems, pattern databases, landmarks, combinations—enable creating admissible, efficient, informative heuristics for diverse domains.
