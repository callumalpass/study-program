# Turing Machines

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this topic, you will be able to:

- Define Turing machines and their formal components
- Design Turing machines for language recognition and computation
- Understand variants of Turing machines and their equivalence
- Apply the Church-Turing thesis to computational problems
- Encode Turing machines and inputs as strings
- Simulate one Turing machine with another
- Understand universal Turing machines

## Core Concepts

Turing machines are the most powerful computational model, equivalent to any general-purpose computer. They can read, write, and move on an infinite tape, providing unlimited memory.

### TM Components

A Turing machine is a 7-tuple (Q, Σ, Γ, δ, q₀, q_accept, q_reject) with states, input/tape alphabets, transition function, and distinguished states for halting.

### Church-Turing Thesis

The thesis states that anything computable by an algorithm can be computed by a Turing machine, establishing the boundaries of computation.
