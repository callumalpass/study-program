# Computational Complexity

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this topic, you will be able to:

- Define time and space complexity classes
- Analyze algorithms using big-O notation for TM computations
- Distinguish between P, NP, and other complexity classes
- Understand NP-completeness and its significance
- Apply reductions to prove NP-completeness
- Analyze polynomial-time reductions
- Understand space complexity and PSPACE

## Core Concepts

Computational complexity classifies problems by the resources (time, space) needed to solve them. It reveals deep structure in the landscape of computational problems.

### Complexity Classes

P contains problems solvable in polynomial time. NP contains problems verifiable in polynomial time. The P vs NP question asks whether verification implies efficient solution.

### NP-Completeness

NP-complete problems are the hardest in NP—solving any one efficiently would solve all of NP efficiently. Cook and Karp established the theory in the 1970s.

## Key Topics

1. **Time Complexity**: Measuring TM running time
