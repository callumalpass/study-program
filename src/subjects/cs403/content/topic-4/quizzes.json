        "correctAnswer": 3,
        "explanation": "Online algorithms must decide as inputs arrive, without seeing the future. This is why competitive analysis compares them to an optimal offline algorithm."

        "explanation": "With cache size 2 and a cycle of 3 pages, LRU will fault on every request after warm-up because it always evicts the page needed soon. OPT would keep the two pages used soonest."
