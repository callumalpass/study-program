  subtopic_requirements:
    - Every distribution introduced with its PDF/PMF, mean, variance, and typical applications
    - Worked examples showing complete solution steps with intermediate calculations
    - Real-world context for statistical concepts (medical, business, science examples)
    - Clear distinction between population parameters and sample statistics
    - Explicit statement of assumptions required for each technique

  conventions:
    - LaTeX for all mathematical expressions
    - Use standard notation (Greek letters for parameters, Latin for statistics)
    - Random variables in uppercase (X, Y), realizations in lowercase (x, y)
    - Consistent use of sigma-notation for sums and integrals

# ==============================================================================
# ASSESSMENT PHILOSOPHY
# ==============================================================================

assessment:
  philosophy: >
    Probability and statistics require both computational fluency and conceptual
    understanding. Students must be able to perform calculations correctly AND
    interpret results meaningfully. Assessment should balance formula application
    with problem setup and interpretation. Real-world context in problems tests
    whether students can translate scenarios into appropriate statistical frameworks.

  measures:
    - Correct computation of probabilities and statistics
    - Appropriate selection of statistical methods
    - Valid interpretation of results in context
    - Proper statement of assumptions and limitations
    - Understanding of when methods apply and don't apply

  anti_patterns:
    - Pure formula memorization without application
    - Problems with unrealistic or decontextualized numbers
    - Questions answerable without understanding the underlying concepts
    - Trick questions exploiting notation ambiguities
    - Questions requiring obscure formulas not covered in content

# ==============================================================================
# GRADING THRESHOLDS
# ==============================================================================

grading:
  passing_score: 70

  thresholds:
    exercises: 70
    quizzes: 65
    exams: 65

  rationale: >
    Standard passing threshold for a core mathematics course. Exercises require
    higher threshold as they provide practice with feedback. Quiz and exam
    thresholds slightly lower to account for time pressure and the multi-step
    nature of statistical problems where early errors propagate.

# ==============================================================================
# EXERCISE SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exercises:
  rationale: >
    Exercises build computational fluency and problem-solving skills. All exercises
    are written (proof/calculation style) because statistics requires showing work,
    stating assumptions, and interpreting results. Automated grading cannot assess
    the quality of statistical interpretations. AI evaluation compares student
    solutions to model answers for both correctness and reasoning quality.

  types:
    coding_with_tests: "0%"
    coding_ai_evaluated: "0%"
    written: "100%"
    justification: >
      This is a mathematical statistics course, not a computational statistics
      course. All exercises involve probability calculations, derivations, and
      statistical inference that require showing work. AI evaluation assesses
      both computational correctness and quality of interpretation.

  per_topic:
    minimum: 14
    target: 16
    maximum: 18
    justification: >
      Full base standard count. Statistics requires volume of practice to build
      intuition for when to apply different techniques. Each exercise is focused
      on one or two concepts but requires multiple steps.

  difficulty_distribution:
    1: 2
    2: 4
    3: 5
    4: 3
    5: 2
    justification: >
      Balanced distribution with slight emphasis on medium difficulty. Statistics
      problems naturally have many steps, so even "easy" problems require work.
      Difficulty 1-2 focus on single concepts; difficulty 4-5 require integrating
      multiple concepts or handling less standard situations.

# ==============================================================================
# QUIZ SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

quizzes:
  rationale: >
    Quizzes test conceptual understanding, formula recall, and quick calculations.
    They identify students who need more practice before attempting longer exercises.
    Mix of question types tests different aspects: definitions, computation, and
    interpretation.

  per_topic:
    count: 3
    questions_each: 5
    justification: >
      Standard base count. Three quizzes per topic allow progression through
      the subtopics within each topic. 15 questions per topic provides good
      coverage without being overwhelming.

  question_types:
    multiple_choice: "50%"
    true_false: "15%"
    fill_blank: "20%"
    code_output: "0%"
    coding: "0%"
    written: "15%"
    justification: >
      Multiple choice tests conceptual understanding and common misconceptions.
      True/false addresses typical errors and misinterpretations. Fill-blank
      tests formula recall and numerical computation. Limited written for
      short interpretation questions.

# ==============================================================================
# EXAM SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exams:
  rationale: >
    Exams require both computation and interpretation under time pressure.
    Mix of short-answer and longer problems tests breadth and depth.
    Calculator use permitted for numerical calculations to focus on
    concepts rather than arithmetic.

  midterm:
    questions:
      minimum: 24
      target: 26
      maximum: 30
    duration_minutes: 90
    format: >
      10-12 short conceptual questions (multiple choice, true/false, fill-blank),
      10-12 calculation problems (expected value, probability, basic inference),
      3-4 written problems requiring setup and interpretation.
    coverage: "Topics 1-4: Probability, Random Variables, Distributions, Statistical Inference"

  final:
    questions:
      minimum: 38
      target: 42
      maximum: 48
    duration_minutes: 120
    format: >
      15-18 short conceptual questions across all topics,
      18-22 calculation problems including regression and Bayesian,
      5-8 written problems integrating multiple concepts.
    coverage: "Comprehensive: all 7 topics with emphasis on hypothesis testing, regression, and Bayesian inference"
    cumulative: true

# ==============================================================================
# PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

projects:
  required: false
  count: 0
  rationale: >
    Mathematics subjects in this curriculum are exam-only without projects.
    The exercises provide sufficient practice, and the mathematical content
    is best assessed through problems and exams rather than extended projects.
    Computational statistics projects (using R or Python) could be added as
    optional enrichment but are not core to this theoretical foundations course.

# ==============================================================================
# SUBJECT-SPECIFIC RED FLAGS
# ==============================================================================

red_flags:
  - Exercise gives probability greater than 1 or less than 0 as answer
  - Hypothesis test conclusion states "accept H0" instead of "fail to reject H0"
  - Confidence interval interpretation uses language suggesting probability of parameter
  - Problem requires distribution table not provided or memorization of obscure values
  - Solution uses method not covered in content (e.g., advanced techniques)
  - Missing units or context in interpretation questions

# ==============================================================================
# NOTES
# ==============================================================================

notes: >
  This course bridges pure mathematics and applied data analysis. Content should
  emphasize both mathematical rigor (proofs of key theorems, derivations of formulas)
  and practical application (when to use which test, how to interpret results).
  Students completing this course should be prepared for machine learning, data science,
  and advanced statistics courses. The Bayesian inference topic provides important
  foundation for modern statistical computing and AI/ML applications.
