# ==============================================================================
# ASSESSMENT PHILOSOPHY
# ==============================================================================

assessment:
  philosophy: >
    Computer graphics requires both theoretical understanding and practical
    implementation skill. Exercises emphasize writing correct, working code
    that produces visible results. Students should be able to implement
    algorithms from specifications and debug visual artifacts.

  measures:
    - Correctness of algorithm implementations
    - Ability to trace through matrix transformations step by step
    - Understanding of when to apply specific techniques
    - Code that produces expected visual output
    - Debugging skills for common graphics artifacts

  anti_patterns:
    - Pure memorization of matrix formulas without understanding
    - Exercises that can only be solved with specific library calls
    - Questions about obscure API details rather than concepts
    - Code that works by trial-and-error rather than understanding

# ==============================================================================
# GRADING THRESHOLDS
# ==============================================================================

grading:
  passing_score: 70

  thresholds:
    exercises: 70
    quizzes: 65
    exams: 65

  rationale: >
    Graphics programming requires precision—off-by-one errors and incorrect
    formulas produce visible artifacts. The passing threshold reflects that
    students must demonstrate competence in core algorithms. Quiz/exam thresholds
    are slightly lower because theoretical questions can be nuanced.

# ==============================================================================
# EXERCISE SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exercises:
  rationale: >
    Graphics exercises focus on implementing algorithms that produce visible
    results. Students should see their code create images, making debugging
    more intuitive. Test cases verify numerical correctness while visual
    output confirms understanding.

  types:
    coding_with_tests: "85%"
    coding_ai_evaluated: "10%"
    written: "5%"
    justification: >
      Most exercises are coding with automated tests for immediate feedback
      on algorithm correctness. Some AI-evaluated exercises for open-ended
      implementations where multiple approaches are valid. A few written
      exercises for deriving transformations or explaining concepts.

  per_topic:
    minimum: 14
    target: 16
    maximum: 18
    justification: >
      Standard base count. Graphics benefits from practice with variations
      on core algorithms. Each exercise builds on previous work, creating
      a progression toward complete implementations.

  difficulty_distribution:
    1: 3
    2: 3
    3: 4
    4: 3
    5: 3
    justification: >
      Standard distribution. Graphics has a natural progression from simple
      primitives to complex effects. Difficulty 5 exercises involve complete
      subsystem implementations (e.g., complete shading model, full rasterizer).

# ==============================================================================
# QUIZ SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

quizzes:
  rationale: >
    Quizzes test theoretical understanding that underpins implementations.
    Students should understand why algorithms work, not just how to code them.
    Code tracing is particularly important for debugging graphics programs.

  per_topic:
    count: 3
    questions_each: 5
    justification: >
      Standard base count. Three quizzes per topic: fundamentals (definitions,
      formulas), application (algorithm tracing, transformations), and mastery
      (debugging scenarios, optimization choices).

  question_types:
    multiple_choice: "50%"
    true_false: "15%"
    fill_blank: "10%"
    code_output: "25%"
    coding: "0%"
    written: "0%"
    justification: >
      Heavy on multiple choice for concept understanding and common pitfalls.
      Code output questions for tracing through transformations and shaders.
      No coding in quizzes—that's what exercises are for.

# ==============================================================================
# EXAM SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exams:
  rationale: >
    Exams test ability to work through graphics problems without IDE support.
    Students should be able to derive transformations, trace through algorithms
    on paper, and identify issues from described symptoms.

  midterm:
    questions:
      minimum: 24
      target: 26
      maximum: 30
    duration_minutes: 90
    format: >
      10-12 multiple choice on concepts and formulas, 8-10 short answer
      requiring matrix derivations or algorithm tracing, 4-6 longer problems
      requiring multi-step solutions.
    coverage: "Topics 1-4: Pipeline, Transformations, Viewing, Rasterization"

  final:
    questions:
      minimum: 38
      target: 42
      maximum: 48
    duration_minutes: 150
    format: >
      15-18 multiple choice covering all topics, 12-15 short answer on
      algorithms and transformations, 8-10 longer problems including
      shader debugging and ray tracing calculations.
    coverage: "Comprehensive: all 7 topics with emphasis on shading and ray tracing"
    cumulative: true

# ==============================================================================
# PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

projects:
  required: true
  count: 3
  rationale: >
    Graphics is fundamentally about building complete rendering systems.
    Projects provide the authentic experience of creating something that
    produces visible images. Three projects cover the major paradigms:
    software rasterization, GPU-based rendering, and ray tracing.

  goals:
    - Implement complete rendering pipelines from scratch
    - Experience debugging visual artifacts
    - Apply optimization techniques for interactive performance
    - Create portfolio-quality visual demonstrations

  estimated_hours: "25-35"

# ==============================================================================
# SUBJECT-SPECIFIC RED FLAGS
# ==============================================================================

red_flags:
  - Code example uses deprecated OpenGL fixed-function pipeline
  - Matrix convention inconsistent within topic (mixing row/column major)
  - Exercise expects specific library (e.g., GLM) without stating so
  - Shader code uses features not available in target GLSL version
  - Test case expects floating-point equality without epsilon tolerance
  - Visual example described but no actual image or diagram provided

# ==============================================================================
# NOTES
# ==============================================================================

notes: >
  Computer Graphics bridges mathematics and visual arts. Content should balance
  rigorous formulas with geometric intuition. Students often struggle with the
  abstract nature of coordinate spaces—use diagrams liberally. Real-time
  performance matters in graphics; mention complexity and optimization where
  relevant. Projects are essential; the satisfaction of seeing rendered images
  motivates continued learning.
