          "Affine transformation"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "Rigid transformations (rotation and translation) preserve both angles and lengths, maintaining the shape and size of objects. They are also called isometric transformations."

        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "Homogeneous coordinates use a 4x4 matrix for 3D transformations, with the extra dimension allowing translation to be represented as a matrix multiplication."

        "prompt": "Matrix multiplication for transformations is commutative (order doesn't matter).",
        "correctAnswer": false,
        "explanation": "Matrix multiplication is not commutative. The order of transformations matters: rotating then translating produces a different result than translating then rotating."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "Points in homogeneous coordinates use w=1, while vectors (representing directions) use w=0. This distinction allows translation to affect points but not directions."

        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "To rotate around point P: first translate P to origin, perform rotation around origin, then translate back to P. This is applied right-to-left in matrix multiplication."

        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "Rotation matrices are orthogonal and have a determinant of 1, indicating they preserve volume and are orientation-preserving transformations."

        "correctAnswer": 3,
        "explanation": "Quaternions provide a robust way to represent rotations without gimbal lock, which occurs with Euler angles when two rotation axes align. They also interpolate smoothly."
