        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "Orthographic projection is a parallel projection that preserves parallel lines and does not apply perspective foreshortening, making objects the same size regardless of distance."

        "prompt": "In perspective projection, objects farther from the camera appear smaller.",
        "correctAnswer": true,
        "explanation": "Perspective projection mimics human vision by applying foreshortening: objects farther away project to smaller sizes on the image plane, creating depth perception."
