        "correctAnswer": "Phong interpolates normals, Gouraud interpolates colors",
        "explanation": "Gouraud shading computes lighting at vertices and interpolates colors across triangles. Phong shading interpolates normals and computes lighting per pixel, producing better specular highlights."

        "correctAnswer": "Uses halfway vector, more efficient and physically plausible",
        "explanation": "Blinn-Phong uses the halfway vector between light and view directions instead of the reflection vector, reducing computation and behaving more like real materials at grazing angles."

        "correctAnswer": "Light intensity decreasing with distance",
        "explanation": "Attenuation models how light intensity decreases with distance from the source, typically using a quadratic falloff (1/(a + b×d + c×d²)) to approximate physical light behavior."
