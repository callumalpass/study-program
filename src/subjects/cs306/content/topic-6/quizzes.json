          "UV coordinates"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 3,
        "explanation": "Texture coordinates are commonly called UV coordinates (u, v), representing 2D positions in texture space, typically normalized to [0,1] range, distinct from spatial XYZ coordinates."

        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Texture filtering (magnification and minification) determines how to sample textures when UVs don't align with texel centers, using methods like nearest neighbor, bilinear, or trilinear filtering."

        "type": "true_false",
        "prompt": "Mipmapping uses a pyramid of progressively smaller texture versions to improve performance and quality.",
        "correctAnswer": true,
        "explanation": "Mipmaps are pre-filtered texture chains at different resolutions (each level half the size). They improve performance by reducing cache misses and quality by preventing aliasing when textures are viewed from far away."

        "correctAnswer": 3,
        "explanation": "Trilinear filtering performs bilinear filtering on the two nearest mipmap levels, then linearly interpolates between those results based on distance, eliminating visible mipmap transitions."

        "correctAnswer": true,
        "explanation": "Anisotropic filtering samples along the direction of maximum texture distortion rather than using square regions, dramatically improving quality for surfaces viewed at steep angles like roads receding into distance."

        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Normal maps encode surface normal vectors as RGB colors (R=X, G=Y, B=Z), allowing per-pixel lighting detail on low-polygon meshes by perturbing surface normals during shading."

          "Clamps UV coordinates to [0,1] range"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 3,
        "explanation": "Clamp mode restricts UV coordinates to [0,1], extending edge pixels infinitely beyond the texture boundary. UVs outside this range sample the nearest edge texel."

        "correctAnswer": 3,

        "correctAnswer": true,
        "explanation": "Parallax mapping offsets texture coordinates based on view angle and a height map, creating the illusion of surface depth and parallax motion without modifying geometry, more convincing than normal mapping alone."

        "correctAnswer": 3,
