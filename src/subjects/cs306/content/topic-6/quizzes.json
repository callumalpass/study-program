          "ST coordinates",
          "RGB coordinates"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "UV coordinates",
        "explanation": "Texture coordinates are commonly called UV coordinates (u, v), representing 2D positions in texture space, typically normalized to [0,1] range, distinct from spatial XYZ coordinates."

        "correctAnswer": "Determine color when texture coordinates fall between pixels",
        "explanation": "Texture filtering (magnification and minification) determines how to sample textures when UVs don't align with texel centers, using methods like nearest neighbor, bilinear, or trilinear filtering."

        "type": "true_false",
        "prompt": "Mipmapping uses a pyramid of progressively smaller texture versions to improve performance and quality.",
        "correctAnswer": "true",
        "explanation": "Mipmaps are pre-filtered texture chains at different resolutions (each level half the size). They improve performance by reducing cache misses and quality by preventing aliasing when textures are viewed from far away."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": "Interpolates between the four nearest texels",
        "explanation": "Bilinear filtering performs linear interpolation in both texture dimensions, blending the four nearest texels to produce smooth results when magnifying or minifying textures."

        "correctAnswer": "Repeat (or Wrap)",
        "explanation": "Repeat/Wrap mode tiles the texture by using the fractional part of UV coordinates, allowing textures to repeat seamlessly across surfaces, useful for patterns like brick walls or grass."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": "Bilinear filtering on two mipmap levels then blending between them",
        "explanation": "Trilinear filtering performs bilinear filtering on the two nearest mipmap levels, then linearly interpolates between those results based on distance, eliminating visible mipmap transitions."

        "correctAnswer": "true",
        "explanation": "Anisotropic filtering samples along the direction of maximum texture distortion rather than using square regions, dramatically improving quality for surfaces viewed at steep angles like roads receding into distance."

        "explanation": "Normal maps encode surface normal vectors as RGB colors (R=X, G=Y, B=Z), allowing per-pixel lighting detail on low-polygon meshes by perturbing surface normals during shading."

          "Uses a specified border color"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "Clamps UV coordinates to [0,1] range",
        "explanation": "Clamp mode restricts UV coordinates to [0,1], extending edge pixels infinitely beyond the texture boundary. UVs outside this range sample the nearest edge texel."

        "correctAnswer": "Combining multiple textures into a single large texture",
        "explanation": "A texture atlas packs multiple smaller textures into one large texture, reducing draw calls and texture binding overhead. Each sub-texture is accessed via specific UV coordinate ranges."

        "correctAnswer": "Per-pixel shininess or reflectivity",
        "explanation": "Specular maps control the intensity and potentially color of specular highlights on a per-pixel basis, allowing different parts of a surface to have varying shininess (e.g., worn vs. polished metal)."
