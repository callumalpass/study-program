# ==============================================================================

    - LaTeX for all mathematical expressions
    - NumPy for from-scratch implementations

# ==============================================================================
# ASSESSMENT PHILOSOPHY
# ==============================================================================

assessment:
  philosophy: >
    Machine learning requires both theoretical understanding and practical skills.
    Exercises should include both mathematical derivations and code implementations.
    Students must be able to implement algorithms from scratch to truly understand them,
    but also use standard libraries effectively for real projects.

  measures:
    - Correct implementation of ML algorithms
    - Appropriate model selection for problem types
    - Proper evaluation methodology (no data leakage)
    - Understanding of mathematical foundations
    - Ability to diagnose and fix model issues

  anti_patterns:
    - Exercises that only test library API knowledge
    - Questions about hyperparameter values without context
    - Ignoring mathematical foundations
    - Not requiring justification for model choices

# ==============================================================================
# GRADING THRESHOLDS
# ==============================================================================

grading:
  passing_score: 70

  thresholds:
    exercises: 70
    quizzes: 65
    exams: 65

  rationale: >
    Standard passing threshold. ML concepts build on each other, so solid
    understanding of foundations is critical. However, some flexibility on
    quizzes/exams since theoretical questions can be challenging.

# ==============================================================================
# EXERCISE SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exercises:
  rationale: >
    Mix of implementation exercises (build algorithms from scratch) and
    applied exercises (use libraries to solve problems). From-scratch
    implementations build deep understanding, library exercises build
    practical skills.

  types:
    coding_with_tests: "60%"
    coding_ai_evaluated: "30%"
    written: "10%"
    justification: >
      Most exercises are coding with test cases for immediate feedback.
      Some AI-evaluated for open-ended model design. Written exercises
      for mathematical derivations and algorithm analysis.

  per_topic:
    minimum: 14
    target: 16
    maximum: 18
    justification: >
      Full base standard. ML requires substantial practice to build intuition.
      Mix of implementation and application exercises.

  difficulty_distribution:
    1: 2
    2: 3
    3: 5
    4: 4
    5: 2
    justification: >
      Balanced distribution leaning toward medium-hard. ML has high floor
      (even "easy" exercises require coding). Difficulty 1-2 for basic
      implementations, 3-4 for full algorithms, 5 for advanced architectures.

# ==============================================================================
# QUIZ SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

quizzes:
  rationale: >
    Quizzes test conceptual understanding of algorithms and their properties.
    Focus on when to use algorithms, their assumptions, and behavior.
    Code output questions for algorithm tracing.

  per_topic:
    count: 3
    questions_each: 5
    justification: >
      Standard base count. Three quizzes per topic covering fundamentals,
      application, and edge cases.

  question_types:
    multiple_choice: "50%"
    true_false: "15%"
    fill_blank: "10%"
    code_output: "20%"
    coding: "0%"
    written: "5%"
    justification: >
      Heavy multiple choice for algorithm properties and comparisons.
      Code output for tracing algorithm behavior. Some written for
      short mathematical explanations.

# ==============================================================================
# EXAM SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exams:
  rationale: >
    Exams test both theoretical understanding and practical algorithm knowledge.
    Mix of conceptual questions and short implementations. Students should
    demonstrate they understand not just what algorithms do, but why.

  midterm:
    questions:
      minimum: 24
      target: 26
      maximum: 30
    duration_minutes: 90
    format: >
      12-14 multiple choice on algorithm properties and comparisons,
      6-8 code tracing/output questions, 4-6 short answer on theory,
      2-3 short implementation questions.
    coverage: "Topics 1-4: ML overview, regression, classification, neural networks"

  final:
    questions:
      minimum: 38
      target: 42
      maximum: 48
    duration_minutes: 150
    format: >
      18-22 multiple choice, 10-12 code tracing, 6-8 short answer,
      4-6 implementation questions. Comprehensive with emphasis on
      deep learning and model evaluation (Topics 5-7).
    coverage: "Comprehensive: all 7 topics"
    cumulative: true

# ==============================================================================
# PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

projects:
  required: true
  count: 2
  rationale: >
    ML is inherently project-based. Students need experience with full
    ML pipelines from data to deployment. Two projects: one classical ML,
    one deep learning.

  goals:
    - Complete end-to-end ML pipeline experience
    - Real dataset preprocessing and feature engineering
    - Model selection and hyperparameter tuning
    - Proper evaluation and result interpretation
    - Experience with both classical ML and deep learning

  estimated_hours: "15-20"

# ==============================================================================
# SUBJECT-SPECIFIC RED FLAGS
# ==============================================================================

red_flags:
  - Exercise uses data not split into train/test properly
  - Solution uses high-level library when from-scratch was requested
  - Quiz question has multiple correct answers without indicating so
  - Content shows accuracy for imbalanced classification without mention of metrics
  - Neural network example without proper weight initialization
  - Gradient descent without learning rate discussion

# ==============================================================================
# NOTES
# ==============================================================================

notes: >
  CS402 is a gateway to advanced AI/ML topics. Students should leave with
  strong foundations that enable them to learn new architectures and
  techniques independently. Emphasize understanding over memorization -
  students who understand gradient descent can learn any optimization-based
  model. Balance theory and practice: every equation should have corresponding
  code, every code example should connect to theory.
