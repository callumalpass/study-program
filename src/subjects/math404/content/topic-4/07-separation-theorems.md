# Separation Theorems

The geometric intuition behind Strong Duality and Lagrange Multipliers comes from the **Separating Hyperplane Theorem**. These theorems describe how disjoint convex sets can be separated by a flat boundary (a hyperplane).

## Hyperplanes and Halfspaces

A **hyperplane** $H$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is defined by a normal vector $a \neq 0$ and a scalar $b$:
$$ H = \{ x \mid a^T x = b \} $$

It divides the space into two closed **halfspaces**:
$$ H^+ = \{ x \mid a^T x \geq b \} $$
$$ H^- = \{ x \mid a^T x \leq b \} $$

## Separating Hyperplane Theorem

**Theorem:** Let $C$ and $D$ be two non-empty **disjoint** convex sets ($C \cap D = \emptyset$). Then there exists a hyperplane that separates them.

That is, there exist $a \neq 0$ and $b$ such that:
$$ a^T x \leq b \quad \forall x \in C $$
$$ a^T x \geq b \quad \forall x \in D $$

**Note:** The inequality might not be strict. The hyperplane might touch the boundaries of the sets.

### Intuition
If you have two convex blobs that don't touch, you can always slide a sheet of paper between them.
If the sets were non-convex (e.g., a C-shape and a dot inside the C), you might not be able to separate them with a straight plane.

## Strict Separation Theorem

To get a strict inequality (gap between sets and plane), we need stronger conditions.

**Theorem:** Let $C$ and $D$ be disjoint convex sets. If $C$ is **closed** and $D$ is **compact** (closed and bounded), then there exists a hyperplane strictly separating them.
$$ a^T x < b < a^T y \quad \forall x \in C, \forall y \in D $$

## Supporting Hyperplane Theorem

What if the sets touch? Or we consider just one set?

A hyperplane $H$ **supports** a set $C$ at a boundary point $x_0$ if:
1.  $x_0 \in H$ (The plane touches the set).
2.  $C \subseteq H^-$ or $C \subseteq H^+$ (The entire set is on one side of the plane).

**Theorem:** Let $C$ be a convex set and $x_0$ be a point on its boundary. Then there exists a supporting hyperplane to $C$ at $x_0$.

**Converse:** If a set $S$ has a supporting hyperplane at every boundary point, and $S$ is closed and has non-empty interior, then $S$ is convex.

## Connection to Optimization

### 1. Optimality Conditions
Consider minimizing $f(x)$ over a convex set $C$. Let $x^*$ be the optimum.
The sublevel set $S = \{ x \mid f(x) \leq f(x^*) \}$ is tangent to $C$ at $x^*$.
By the Separation Theorem, there is a hyperplane separating $S$ and $C$.
The normal vector to this hyperplane relates to the negative gradient $-\nabla f(x^*)$.
This geometric tangency leads to the condition:
$$ \nabla f(x^*)^T (x - x^*) \geq 0 \quad \forall x \in C $$
"Any feasible direction moves uphill."

### 2. Duality
Recall the set of possible values $G = \{ (Ax, c^T x) \mid x \geq 0 \}$ in linear programming.
The point $(b, z^*)$ is on the boundary of this set.
The supporting hyperplane at this point has a normal vector that corresponds to the **Dual Variables** $y$.
The equation of the supporting hyperplane explains why $b^T y = c^T x$.

### 3. Farkas' Lemma
Farkas' Lemma is essentially the Separating Hyperplane Theorem applied to a convex cone and a point outside it.
- Set $C$ = Cone generated by $A$.
- Set $D$ = Point $b$.
- If $b \notin C$, there is a plane separating $b$ and $C$. The normal vector is the certificate $y$.

## Summary

In Convex Optimization, geometry precedes algebra.
- **Convexity** allows separation.
- **Separation** gives existence of dual variables (multipliers).
- **Dual variables** provide optimality conditions (KKT).
- **KKT conditions** enable algorithms.
