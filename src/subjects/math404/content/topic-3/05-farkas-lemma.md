# Farkas' Lemma

**Farkas' Lemma** is a "Theorem of the Alternative" for systems of linear inequalities. It states that for a specific system of linear equations and inequalities, exactly one of two distinct systems has a solution. It is the fundamental building block for the Strong Duality Theorem and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions.

## The Lemma

**Theorem (Farkas' Lemma):**
Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix and $b \in \mathbb{R}^m$ be a vector. Then **exactly one** of the following two systems has a solution:

1.  **System 1:** $Ax = b$ and $x \geq 0$.
2.  **System 2:** $A^T y \geq 0$ and $b^T y < 0$.

### Interpretation

**System 1** asks: "Is $b$ inside the convex cone generated by the columns of $A$?"
$$ b = x_1 \mathbf{a}_1 + x_2 \mathbf{a}_2 + \dots + x_n \mathbf{a}_n, \quad x_i \geq 0 $$

**System 2** asks: "Is there a hyperplane defined by normal vector $y$ that separates $b$ from this cone?"
- $A^T y \geq 0 \iff \mathbf{a}_i^T y \geq 0$ for all $i$. This means the angle between $y$ and every column $\mathbf{a}_i$ is less than or equal to $90^\circ$. So $y$ makes an acute angle with the entire cone.
- $b^T y < 0$. This means the angle between $y$ and $b$ is greater than $90^\circ$.

Geometrically, this means we can pass a plane through the origin (normal $y$) such that all columns of $A$ are on one side (the "positive" side), but $b$ is strictly on the other side.

Farkas' Lemma says: Either $b$ is in the cone, OR you can separate $b$ from the cone with a hyperplane. Both cannot be true, and one must be true.

## Proof Sketch (Geometric)

1.  **Easy direction (Mutually Exclusive):**
    Suppose both have solutions $x$ and $y$.
    Consider the quantity $y^T A x$.
    - From System 1 ($Ax=b$): $y^T (Ax) = y^T b = b^T y < 0$ (from System 2).
    - From System 2 ($A^T y \geq 0$): $y^T A x = (A^T y)^T x$. Since $A^T y \geq 0$ and $x \geq 0$, their dot product must be $\geq 0$.
    - Contradiction: $0 \leq y^T A x < 0$.
    Thus, they cannot both have solutions.

2.  **Hard direction (One must exist):**
    Let $C = \{ Ax \mid x \geq 0 \}$ be the convex cone generated by columns of $A$.
    If System 1 has no solution, then $b \notin C$.
    Since $C$ is a closed convex set and $b$ is a point outside it, by the **Separating Hyperplane Theorem**, there exists a hyperplane separating $b$ from $C$.
    Since $C$ is a cone containing the origin, this separating hyperplane must pass through the origin (or can be shifted to).
    This hyperplane gives us the vector $y$ satisfying System 2.

## Variants of Farkas' Lemma

There are many forms, depending on the constraints.

**Variant 1 (Gordan's Theorem):**
Exactly one has a solution:
1. $Ax = 0, x > 0$ (Strictly positive solution)
2. $A^T y \geq 0, A^T y \neq 0$ (Non-zero non-negative combination)

**Variant 2 (Stiemke's Theorem):**
Exactly one has a solution:
1. $Ax = 0, x \geq 0, Ax \neq 0$
2. $A^T y > 0$

**Variant 3 (Ville's Theorem):**
Exactly one has a solution:
1. $Ax < 0, x > 0$
2. $A^T y \geq 0, y \geq 0, y \neq 0$

## Application: Proof of Strong Duality

We can use Farkas' Lemma to prove Strong Duality for LP.

Consider the Primal: Max $c^T x$ s.t. $Ax \leq b, x \geq 0$.
Assume Primal has optimal value $z^*$.
We want to show Dual (Min $b^T y$ s.t. $A^T y \geq c, y \geq 0$) has a solution with value $z^*$.

Is there a solution to:
$A^T y \geq c$
$y \geq 0$
$b^T y \leq z^*$ (Dual objective $\leq$ Primal optimal)

We can rewrite this system and apply Farkas' Lemma. If this system has no solution, Farkas' Lemma implies a contradiction with the optimality of $z^*$.

## Application: Arbitrage Pricing

In finance, Farkas' Lemma is the core of the **Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing**.

Let $A$ be a matrix of asset payoffs (rows = assets, columns = future states).
Let $p$ be the current prices of assets.

System 1: $Ax = p, x > 0$.
(Does there exist a "state price" vector $x$ that explains current prices?)

System 2: $A^T y \geq 0, p^T y < 0$.
(Does there exist a portfolio $y$—quantities of assets—such that payoff is non-negative in all future states ($A^T y \geq 0$) but current cost is negative ($p^T y < 0$)? i.e., "Free money"?)

Farkas says: Either consistent state prices exist (No Arbitrage), OR an arbitrage opportunity exists.

## Example

$A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad b = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}$

**System 1:**
$x_1 = -1, x_2 = -1, x \geq 0$.
Impossible. No solution.

**System 2:**
Find $y$ such that $y_1 \geq 0, y_2 \geq 0$ and $-y_1 - y_2 < 0$.
Easy! $y = (1, 1)$.
$A^T y = [1, 1]^T \geq 0$.
$b^T y = -2 < 0$.
Solution exists.

Consistent with Lemma: System 1 No, System 2 Yes.
