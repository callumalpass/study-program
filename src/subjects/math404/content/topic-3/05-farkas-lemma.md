# Farkas' Lemma

## Statement

**Theorem (Farkas' Lemma)**: Exactly one of the following holds:

1. There exists $x \geq 0$ such that $Ax = b$
2. There exists $y$ such that $A^T y \geq 0$ and $b^T y < 0$

## Geometric Interpretation

System $Ax = b$, $x \geq 0$ is feasible ⟺ $b$ is in the cone generated by columns of $A$

## Applications

- Proving strong duality
- Certifying infeasibility
- Constraint qualification conditions

## Python Example

```python
import cvxpy as cp
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 1], [-1, -1]])
b = np.array([3, 3, -5])

# Try to find x >= 0 with Ax = b
x = cp.Variable(2, nonneg=True)
prob1 = cp.Problem(cp.Minimize(0), [A @ x == b])
prob1.solve()

if prob1.status == 'optimal':
    print(f"System feasible: x = {x.value}")
else:
    # Find certificate of infeasibility
    y = cp.Variable(3)
    prob2 = cp.Problem(cp.Minimize(b @ y), [A.T @ y >= 0])
    prob2.solve()
    print(f"System infeasible, certificate: y = {y.value}")
    print(f"A^T y = {A.T @ y.value} (should be >= 0)")
    print(f"b^T y = {b @ y.value:.4f} (should be < 0)")
```
