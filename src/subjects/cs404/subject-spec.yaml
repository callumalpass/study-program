# ==============================================================================
# PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH
# ==============================================================================

pedagogy:
  knowledge_type: applied

  mastery_indicators:
    - Creates comprehensive project documentation (spec, design, API)
    - Sets up and maintains professional development infrastructure (CI/CD, testing)
    - Manages project lifecycle including risks, timeline, and quality
    - Delivers polished demos and presentations
    - Writes clear, maintainable technical documentation

  common_struggles:
    - Underestimating time requirements (optimism bias)
    - Neglecting non-functional requirements
    - Skipping documentation or testing under pressure
    - Poor scope management and feature creep
    - Inadequate error handling and edge case coverage

# ==============================================================================
# CONTENT STANDARDS
# ==============================================================================

content:
  subtopic_requirements:
    - Include templates or examples for documentation
    - Practical scenarios for decision making
    - Real-world case studies where applicable
    - Checklists and best practices for each phase

  conventions:
    - Agile/Scrum terminology
    - Industry standard tools (Git, Docker, etc. mentioned generically)
    - Platform-agnostic examples where possible

# ==============================================================================
# ASSESSMENT PHILOSOPHY
# ==============================================================================

assessment:
  philosophy: >
    Focus on the process and artifacts of software delivery, not just the final code.
    Students should demonstrate professional-quality deliverables at each project phase.

  measures:
    - Quality of documentation and planning artifacts
    - Effectiveness of setup and process (CI/CD, testing)
    - Practical application of project management concepts
    - Ability to identify and mitigate risks

  anti_patterns:
    - Pure theory questions without scenario context
    - Ignoring the "soft skills" aspect of project management
    - Testing memorization of tool commands rather than understanding

# ==============================================================================
# GRADING THRESHOLDS
# ==============================================================================

grading:
  passing_score: 70

  thresholds:
    exercises: 70
    quizzes: 70
    exams: 65

  rationale: >
    High standard required for capstone-level professional preparation.
    Lower exam threshold acknowledges scenario-based questions can be challenging.

# ==============================================================================
# EXERCISE SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exercises:
  rationale: >
    Mix of document creation and technical configuration. Students practice
    both the planning/documentation side and the technical implementation side
    of project delivery.

  types:
    coding_with_tests: "30%"
    coding_ai_evaluated: "30%"
    written: "40%"
    justification: >
      Heavy focus on documentation and process artifacts (written) and
      configuration (coding/AI). Many capstone deliverables are documents,
      not code.

  per_topic:
    minimum: 10
    target: 16
    maximum: 20
    justification: Standard volume to practice various aspects of the topic.

  difficulty_distribution:
    1: 3
    2: 3
    3: 4
    4: 3
    5: 3
    justification: >
      Standard distribution. Capstone exercises should challenge students
      across all difficulty levels as they prepare for professional work.

# ==============================================================================
# QUIZ SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

quizzes:
  rationale: Verify understanding of concepts and terminology.

  per_topic:
    count: 3
    questions_each: 5
    justification: Standard check for concept retention.

  question_types:
    multiple_choice: "60%"
    true_false: "20%"
    fill_blank: "20%"
    code_output: "0%"
    coding: "0%"
    written: "0%"
    justification: >
      Conceptual checks mostly. Code output not relevant for project
      management and documentation topics.

# ==============================================================================
# EXAM SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exams:
  rationale: >
    Comprehensive review of methodologies and practices. Exams use
    scenario-based questions that mirror real project decisions.

  midterm:
    questions:
      minimum: 20
      target: 25
      maximum: 30
    duration_minutes: 75
    format: Scenario-based MC and short answer
    coverage: Topics 1-4 (Planning through Implementation Phase 2)

  final:
    questions:
      minimum: 35
      target: 40
      maximum: 50
    duration_minutes: 120
    format: Comprehensive scenario analysis
    coverage: All topics
    cumulative: true

# ==============================================================================
# PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

projects:
  required: true
  count: 7

  rationale: >
    The course itself is structured around a semester-long project lifecycle
    broken into 7 phases. Each topic corresponds to a project phase deliverable.

  goals:
    - Apply all learned phases to a single coherent project
    - Build a portfolio-ready project from start to finish
    - Practice professional software development workflow
    - Experience the full project lifecycle

  estimated_hours: "40+"

# ==============================================================================
# SUBJECT-SPECIFIC RED FLAGS
# ==============================================================================

red_flags:
  - Theoretical questions that ignore practical reality
  - Outdated waterfall-only methodologies
  - Tool-specific commands without explaining the concept
  - Exercises that can't be completed without specific paid tools
  - Content that doesn't reflect modern development practices

# ==============================================================================
# NOTES
# ==============================================================================

notes: >
  Ensure content balances technical tooling with management process.
  Students should understand both the "what" and the "why" of each practice.
  Examples should be practical and applicable to real projects.
