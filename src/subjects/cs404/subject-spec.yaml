title: Software Project Management
category: cs
role:
  level: advanced
  transformation: From "coding in isolation" to "delivering professional software projects in a team context"
pedagogy:
  knowledge_type: applied
  mastery_indicators:
    - Creates comprehensive project documentation (spec, design, API)
    - Sets up and maintains professional development infrastructure (CI/CD, testing)
    - Manages project lifecycle including risks, timeline, and quality
  common_struggles:
    - Undestimating time requirements (optimism bias)
    - Neglecting non-functional requirements
    - Skipping documentation or testing under pressure
content:
  subtopic_requirements:
    - Include templates or examples for documentation
    - Practical scenarios for decision making
  conventions:
    - Agile/Scrum terminology
    - Industry standard tools (Git, Docker, etc. mentioned generically)
assessment:
  philosophy: Focus on the process and artifacts of software delivery, not just the final code.
  measures:
    - Quality of documentation and planning artifacts
    - Effectiveness of setup and process (CI/CD, testing)
    - Practical application of project management concepts
  anti_patterns:
    - Pure theory questions without scenario context
    - Ignoring the "soft skills" aspect of project management
grading:
  passing_score: 70
  rationale: High standard required for capstone-level professional preparation.
exercises:
  rationale: Mix of document creation and technical configuration.
  types:
    coding_with_tests: "30%"
    coding_ai_evaluated: "30%"
    written: "40%"
    justification: Heavy focus on documentation and process artifacts (written) and configuration (coding/AI).
  per_topic:
    minimum: 10
    target: 16
    maximum: 20
    justification: Standard volume to practice various aspects of the topic.
quizzes:
  rationale: Verify understanding of concepts and terminology.
  per_topic:
    count: 3
    questions_each: 5
    justification: Standard check.
  question_types:
    multiple_choice: "60%"
    true_false: "20%"
    fill_blank: "20%"
    code_output: "0%"
    coding: "0%"
    written: "0%"
    justification: Conceptual checks mostly.
exams:
  rationale: Comprehensive review of methodologies and practices.
  midterm:
    questions:
      minimum: 20
      target: 25
      maximum: 30
    duration_minutes: 75
    format: Scenario-based MC and short answer
    coverage: Topics 1-4
  final:
    questions:
      minimum: 35
      target: 40
      maximum: 50
    duration_minutes: 120
    format: Comprehensive scenario analysis
    coverage: All topics
    cumulative: true
projects:
  required: true
  count: 7
  rationale: The course itself is structured around a semester-long project lifecycle broken into 7 phases.
  goals:
    - Apply all learned phases to a single coherent project
  estimated_hours: "40+"
red_flags:
  - Theoretical questions that ignore practical reality
  - Outdated waterfall-only methodologies
notes: Ensure content balances technical tooling with management process.
