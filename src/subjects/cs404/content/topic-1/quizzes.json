        "prompt": "What is the primary goal of defining an MVP (Minimum Viable Product)?",
        "options": [
          "To deliver the minimum features that provide value and can be built within constraints",
          "To avoid building complex features",
          "To create a prototype for testing only",
          "To build the smallest possible product"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "An MVP includes the minimum set of features that solve the core problem, deliver value to users, and can be realistically built within time and resource constraints."

          "Non-functional requirement"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 3,
        "explanation": "This is a non-functional requirement because it specifies HOW the system should perform (performance constraint) rather than WHAT it should do."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 3,
        "explanation": "A 20-30% buffer is recommended for capstone projects, so 100 hours * 1.2-1.3 = 120-130 hours total budget to account for unexpected challenges."

          "Functional is what the system does, non-functional is how well it does it"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 3,
        "explanation": "Functional requirements define WHAT the system should do (features/behavior), while non-functional requirements define HOW WELL it should perform (performance, security, usability)."

        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "Good acceptance criteria are specific, measurable, and testable so you can objectively verify when a feature is complete."
