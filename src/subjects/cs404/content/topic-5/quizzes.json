        "options": [
          "More E2E tests, fewer unit tests",
          "Equal amounts of all test types",
          "More unit tests at the base, fewer E2E tests at the top",
          "Only write E2E tests for full coverage"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "The testing pyramid recommends many fast unit tests at the base, fewer integration tests in the middle, and few slow E2E tests at the top."

          "They don't require mocking"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "Unit tests are fast because they test small pieces in isolation, and failures pinpoint exactly which unit is broken."

        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "Unit tests test individual functions in isolation. Integration tests verify multiple components work together correctly (e.g., API + database)."

          "Having a dedicated testing team"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,

          "They test more code at once"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "E2E tests are slow because they interact with the full stack: rendering UI, making real network requests, and interacting with databases."
