      {
        "id": "q1",
        "type": "multiple_choice",
        "prompt": "In a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), what is a domain?",
        "options": [
          "The set of possible values that a variable can take",
          "A restriction on which variable combinations are valid",
          "The order in which variables should be assigned",
          "The goal state we are trying to reach"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "A domain is the set of all possible values that can be assigned to a variable. For example, in map coloring, the domain might be {red, green, blue}. This is distinct from constraints, which limit which combinations of values are permitted across multiple variables."
      },
      {
        "id": "q2",
        "type": "multiple_choice",
        "prompt": "What is the main purpose of the AC-3 algorithm in CSP?",
        "options": [
          "To find the optimal solution quickly",

          "To select which variable to assign next",
          "To backtrack when a dead end is reached"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "AC-3 (Arc Consistency Algorithm 3) enforces arc consistency by iteratively removing values from variable domains that have no supporting values in constrained neighbor variables. This preprocessing step can significantly reduce the search space before or during backtracking search."

      {
        "id": "q3",
        "type": "true_false",
        "prompt": "The Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) heuristic always guarantees finding a solution faster than choosing variables in a fixed order.",
        "correctAnswer": false,
        "explanation": "While MRV often improves performance by detecting failures early, it does not guarantee faster solution finding in all cases. The effectiveness depends on the problem structure. MRV chooses the most constrained variable, which typically prunes the search space more effectively, but worst-case complexity remains the same."

        "prompt": "The heuristic that selects the value that rules out the fewest choices for neighboring variables is called _____.",
        "correctAnswer": "Least Constraining Value",
        "explanation": "The Least Constraining Value (LCV) heuristic prefers the value that leaves maximum flexibility for future assignments. By choosing values that impose the fewest constraints on unassigned variables, LCV increases the likelihood of finding a solution without backtracking."

        "correctAnswer": "None",
        "explanation": "When no values in a variable's domain are consistent with the current assignment, the inner loop completes without finding a valid assignment, and the function returns None to trigger backtracking. This is the fundamental mechanism for exploring the search space by undoing previous assignments when conflicts arise."

          "Selects the next variable to assign using MRV"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Forward checking is a constraint propagation technique that, after each assignment, immediately removes values from the domains of unassigned variables that are neighbors of the assigned variable if those values would violate constraints. This early detection of failures reduces unnecessary search."

        "correctAnswer": "{green, blue}",
        "explanation": "Since WA (Western Australia) is assigned red and is adjacent to NT (Northern Territory), forward checking removes 'red' from NT's domain to maintain the constraint that adjacent regions must have different colors. This leaves NT with the domain {green, blue}."

        "correctAnswer": false,
        "explanation": "Min-conflicts is a local search algorithm that is incomplete - it may get stuck in local minima and fail to find a solution even when one exists. However, it is very effective for certain problems like n-queens and can find solutions quickly when they exist, especially with random restarts."

          "The variable with the fewest legal values",
          "The first unassigned variable in order"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Min-conflicts randomly selects a variable that is currently in conflict (violating at least one constraint). It then changes that variable's value to the one that minimizes the number of conflicts. This random selection helps avoid getting stuck and provides good practical performance."

        "correctAnswer": "largest",
        "explanation": "The degree heuristic chooses the variable involved in the largest number of constraints with other unassigned variables. This is often used as a tie-breaker with MRV, helping to reduce branching factor early by assigning highly connected variables first."

        "options": [
          "It runs AC-3 after each variable assignment and before selecting the next variable",
          "It only checks arcs once at the beginning of search",
          "It guarantees finding the optimal solution",
          "It is less effective than simple forward checking"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "Maintaining Arc Consistency (MAC) enforces arc consistency after each assignment by running AC-3 on the arcs involving unassigned variables. This is more powerful than forward checking as it propagates constraints further, often detecting failures earlier and reducing the search space more effectively."

        "correctAnswer": "Move queen at col 0 to row 1",
        "explanation": "For column 0, the algorithm evaluates moving the queen from row 3 to each possible row (0-3) and counts conflicts. Row 1 minimizes conflicts with the other queens. Min-conflicts chooses this value to reduce the total number of constraint violations."

        "prompt": "Arc consistency eliminates all values that could not be part of any solution to the CSP.",
        "correctAnswer": false,
        "explanation": "Arc consistency only ensures local consistency between pairs of variables. It does not guarantee global consistency or eliminate all values that cannot be part of a solution. Stronger notions like path consistency or k-consistency are needed for more comprehensive pruning, but even these may not eliminate all impossible values."

        "prompt": "In CSP, a _____ constraint involves more than two variables and cannot be reduced to binary constraints.",
        "correctAnswer": "global",
        "explanation": "Global constraints (also called n-ary or higher-order constraints) involve three or more variables and often have special-purpose propagation algorithms. Examples include AllDifferent (all variables must have different values) and resource constraints. These are more expressive and efficient than decomposing into multiple binary constraints."

          "O(d^n) where d is domain size and n is variables"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "AC-3 has worst-case time complexity O(ed³) where e is the number of arcs (constraints) and d is the maximum domain size. Each arc can be added to the queue at most d times, and checking consistency for each value takes O(d²) time in the worst case. This is polynomial in the problem size, making AC-3 practical for preprocessing."
