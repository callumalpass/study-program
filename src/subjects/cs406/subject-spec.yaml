# PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH
# ==============================================================================

pedagogy:
  knowledge_type: mixed

  mastery_indicators:

    - Misunderstanding alpha-beta pruning mechanics
    - Probability calculation errors in Bayesian networks
    - Confusing forward and backward chaining in logical inference
    - Failing to properly formulate problems as search/CSP problems

# ==============================================================================
# CONTENT STANDARDS
# ==============================================================================

content:
  subtopic_requirements:
    - Every algorithm must include pseudocode and Python implementation
    - Complexity analysis (time and space) for all algorithms
    - Worked examples showing step-by-step algorithm execution
    - Comparison between related approaches (e.g., DFS vs BFS)
    - Practical application examples for each technique

  conventions:
    - Python 3.10+ for all code examples
    - LaTeX for mathematical notation and formulas
    - Mermaid diagrams for algorithm visualization
    - Consistent notation for search (state space, operators)

# ==============================================================================
# ASSESSMENT PHILOSOPHY
# ==============================================================================

assessment:
  philosophy: >
    AI requires both theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills.
    Students must understand why algorithms work (theory) and be able to implement
    them correctly (practice). Assessments balance code implementation with
    conceptual analysis and algorithm tracing.

  measures:
    - Correct algorithm implementation
    - Complexity analysis accuracy
    - Problem formulation skills (modeling as search, CSP, etc.)
    - Algorithm trace correctness (step-by-step execution)
    - Appropriate technique selection for given problems

  anti_patterns:
    - Memorizing algorithm code without understanding
    - Questions answerable by pattern matching
    - Problems with only one valid approach
    - Ignoring edge cases in implementations

# ==============================================================================
# GRADING THRESHOLDS
# ==============================================================================

grading:
  passing_score: 70

  thresholds:
    exercises: 70
    quizzes: 65
    exams: 65

  rationale: >
    Standard thresholds for an advanced CS course. Implementation exercises have
    higher requirements because partial solutions often don't function. Quiz and
    exam thresholds slightly lower to account for conceptual complexity.

# ==============================================================================
# EXERCISE SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exercises:
  rationale: >
    AI exercises mix algorithm implementation with problem analysis. Students
    should implement core algorithms from scratch to understand them deeply,
    then apply them to novel problems. Each topic balances coding with
    conceptual exercises.

  types:
    coding_with_tests: "75%"
    coding_ai_evaluated: "15%"
    written: "10%"
    justification: >
      Most exercises are coding with automated tests for immediate feedback on
      algorithm correctness. Some AI-evaluated coding for open-ended design
      problems (evaluation functions, heuristics). Written exercises for
      analysis and proof-style questions.

  per_topic:
    minimum: 14
    target: 16
    maximum: 18
    justification: >
      Full base count. AI concepts require substantial practice implementing
      algorithms and solving problems. Each exercise should take 15-30 minutes.

  difficulty_distribution:
    1: 2
    2: 3
    3: 5
    4: 4
    5: 2
    justification: >
      Slightly harder distribution than intro courses. Difficulty 1-2 for
      implementing basic algorithm variants. Difficulty 3-4 for applying
      algorithms to novel problems. Difficulty 5 for optimization and
      advanced analysis.

# ==============================================================================
# QUIZ SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

quizzes:
  rationale: >
    Quizzes test algorithm tracing and conceptual understanding. Students should
    be able to trace algorithm execution by hand and predict outcomes. Questions
    cover properties, complexity, and correct application of techniques.

  per_topic:
    count: 3
    questions_each: 5
    justification: >
      Standard base count. Three quizzes allow progression from basic concepts
      to algorithm tracing to analysis questions.

  question_types:
    multiple_choice: "40%"
    true_false: "15%"
    fill_blank: "15%"
    code_output: "30%"
    coding: "0%"
    written: "0%"
    justification: >
      Heavy on code_output for algorithm tracing (predict search order, values).
      Multiple choice for conceptual understanding. Fill-blank for terminology
      and algorithm properties.

# ==============================================================================
# EXAM SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exams:
  rationale: >
    Exams test comprehensive understanding of AI techniques. Mix of algorithm
    tracing, implementation, and analysis. Students should be able to trace
    algorithms by hand, implement them in pseudocode, and analyze complexity.

  midterm:
    questions:
      minimum: 24
      target: 26
      maximum: 30
    duration_minutes: 75
    format: >
      8-10 algorithm tracing questions (search, minimax), 8-10 multiple choice
      conceptual questions, 5-8 short coding/pseudocode problems.
    coverage: "Topics 1-4: AI fundamentals, search, adversarial search, CSP"

  final:
    questions:
      minimum: 38
      target: 42
      maximum: 48
    duration_minutes: 120
    format: >
      12-15 algorithm tracing, 12-15 multiple choice, 10-15 short problems.
      Cumulative with emphasis on later topics (planning, logic, probability).
    coverage: "Comprehensive: all 7 topics"
    cumulative: true

# ==============================================================================
# PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

projects:
  required: true
  count: 2
  rationale: >
    AI projects integrate multiple techniques for substantial applications.
    Projects give students experience building complete AI systems (game players,
    planners, inference engines) that apply course concepts.

  goals:
    - Integrate multiple AI techniques in one system
    - Experience building complete intelligent agents
    - Apply algorithms to real or realistic problems
    - Practice algorithm selection and tuning
    - Create portfolio-worthy AI projects

  estimated_hours: "15-25"

# ==============================================================================
# SUBJECT-SPECIFIC RED FLAGS
# ==============================================================================

red_flags:
  - Exercise requires libraries not taught (e.g., scikit-learn for core algorithms)
  - Algorithm trace question has ambiguous tie-breaking rules
  - Heuristic exercise doesn't clarify admissibility requirements
  - CSP exercise missing variable domain specifications
  - Probability question uses incorrect independence assumptions
  - Search problem missing goal test or cost function

# ==============================================================================
# NOTES
# ==============================================================================

notes: >
  CS406 covers classical AI techniques that form the foundation for modern AI.
  While machine learning and deep learning are transformative, students need
  solid grounding in search, logic, and probability. Content should emphasize
  that these techniques remain essential and are often combined with learning
  approaches in modern systems. Code should be clear and well-commented,
  suitable for students new to AI implementation.
