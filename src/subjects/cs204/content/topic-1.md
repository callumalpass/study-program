# Software Development Lifecycle

The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) provides a structured framework for planning, creating, testing, and deploying software systems. Understanding different lifecycle models helps developers choose appropriate methodologies for various project types and organizational contexts.

## Overview

The SDLC encompasses all phases of software development from initial concept to deployment and maintenance. Different models emphasize different aspects of the process and suit different project characteristics.

## Key Concepts

### Phases of Development
- **Requirements**: Gathering and documenting what the software should do
- **Design**: Creating architectural and detailed designs
- **Implementation**: Writing code to realize the design
- **Testing**: Verifying the software meets requirements
- **Deployment**: Releasing software to users
- **Maintenance**: Ongoing support and enhancement

### Traditional Models
- **Waterfall**: Sequential phases with clear boundaries
- **V-Model**: Pairs each development phase with testing phase
- **Incremental**: Delivers software in small increments

### Iterative Models
- **Spiral**: Risk-driven with repeated cycles
- **Prototyping**: Build prototypes to clarify requirements
- **RAD**: Rapid Application Development with time-boxing
