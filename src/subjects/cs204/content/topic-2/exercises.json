Undefined Mechanism**\n- *Problem:* \"prevent overenrollment\" - doesn't specify how or what happens when attempted\n- *Fix:* \"The system shall prevent registration when enrolled count equals course capacity. Users attempting to register for full courses shall be offered waitlist enrollment if available, or shown alternative sections.\"\n\n**3. Missing Functionality**\n- *Problem:* \"Professors can see their class rosters\" - view only? What actions can they take?\n- *Fix:* \"Professors can view class rosters, export to CSV/PDF, send mass emails to enrolled students, and view student photos if authorized.\"\n\n**4. Incomplete Constraint**\n- *Problem:* \"Prerequisites must be satisfied\" - who checks? What if override needed?\n- *Fix:* \"The system shall automatically verify prerequisite completion before allowing registration. Department advisors can grant prerequisite overrides with documented justification.\"\n\n**5. Timeline Inconsistency**\n- *Problem:* Registration opens \"second week\" but drop without penalty is \"first week\" - these conflict\n- *Fix:* Clarify timeline: \"Registration opens during Week 8 of the prior semester. Drop without penalty period extends through Week 2 of the current semester.\"\n\n**6. Overly Broad Permission**\n- *Problem:* \"Administrative users have access to everything\" - security risk, no role definition\n- *Fix:* Define specific administrative roles: \"Registrar staff can modify any enrollment. Department admins can modify enrollments within their department. System admins can manage user accounts and system configuration.\"\n\n**7. Vague Scalability Requirement**\n- *Problem:* \"handle many concurrent users\" - not measurable\n- *Fix:* \"The system shall support 5,000 concurrent users during registration periods while maintaining response times under 3 seconds.\"\n\n**8. Missing Requirements - Omissions Identified:**\n- *Problem:* No mention of: waitlists, credit hour limits, advisor holds, registration time windows, audit enrollment, cross-registration, accessibility requirements\n- *Fix:* Add requirements for each: \"Students may register for maximum 18 credit hours without advisor override. Students with registration holds cannot enroll until holds are cleared.\""

No competitive advantage or value proposition.\n\n2. **Resource Reality:** Uber has thousands of engineers and billions in funding. A startup cannot replicate their feature set with limited resources.\n\n3. **Hidden Complexity:** Visible features (app UI) are 10% of the system. The remaining 90% (fraud detection, surge pricing algorithms, driver incentives, regulatory compliance) isn't visible.\n\n4. **Legal/Regulatory:** Uber's approach may include licensing, insurance structures, and regulatory relationships specific to their scale and history.\n\n5. **Technical Debt vs. Innovation:** Uber carries years of legacy decisions. A new entrant can make better architectural choices.\n\n6. **Unknown Requirements:** \"What Uber has\" doesn't capture the founder's actual vision, target market, or differentiators.\n\n---\n\n**ELICITATION APPROACH:**\n\n**Phase 1: Stakeholder Interviews**\n\n*Questions for Founder:*\n- \"What problem are you really trying to solve that isn't being solved?\"\n- \"Who is your ideal first customer? What geographic market?\"\n- \"What would make riders choose you over Uber specifically?\"\n- \"What's your budget and timeline for MVP?\"\n- \"What happens if you can't get drivers? Riders?\"\n- \"What regulations exist in your target market?\"\n\n*Questions for Potential Users (Riders):*\n- \"What frustrates you about your current ride-sharing app?\"\n- \"What would make you try a new ride-sharing service?\"\n- \"How do you currently handle rides that apps don't serve well?\"\n- \"What's most important: price, speed, safety, or something else?\"\n\n*Questions for Potential Drivers:*\n- \"What do you like/dislike about driving for current platforms?\"\n- \"What would make you switch to a new platform?\"\n- \"How do you decide when and where to drive?\"\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2: Competitive Analysis (Document Analysis)**\n\n- Analyze Uber, Lyft, and regional competitors\n- Identify table-stakes features vs. differentiators\n- Review public complaints and pain points\n- Study regulatory requirements in target markets\n\n---\n\n**Phase 3: Market Positioning Workshop**\n\nFacilitated session to define:\n- Target market segment (e.g., college campuses, suburban areas, specific city)\n- Unique value proposition (e.g., \"rides for seniors,\" \"eco-friendly rides only,\" \"subscription-based\")\n- MVP feature set (what's essential for launch vs. later)\n- Competitive positioning matrix\n\n---\n\n**Phase 4: Prototype and Validate**\n\n- Create low-fidelity prototypes of key differentiating features\n- Test with target users\n- Validate assumptions about what users want\n- Refine requirements based on feedback\n\n---\n\n**RECOMMENDED OUTPUT:**\n\nInstead of \"copy Uber,\" deliver:\n\n1. **Vision Statement:** \"A ride-sharing platform for [target market] that differentiates through [unique value]\"\n\n2. **Prioritized Feature List:** MoSCoW prioritized, with MVP clearly defined\n\n3. **User Stories:** For each feature, tied to specific user personas\n\n4. **Non-Functional Requirements:** Performance, security, and scalability appropriate to startup scale (not Uber scale)\n\n5. **Regulatory Checklist:** Compliance requirements for target market\n\n6. **Success Metrics:** How we measure if we're achieving goals\n\n---\n\n**KEY INSIGHT:**\n\nThe goal isn't to capture what Uber built—it's to discover what this startup should build. That requires understanding the market, the users, the competitive landscape, and the founder's actual vision and constraints."
