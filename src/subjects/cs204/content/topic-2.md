# Requirements Engineering

Requirements Engineering is a critical discipline in software engineering that focuses on identifying, documenting, and maintaining the requirements of a software system. Effective requirements engineering ensures that the final software product meets stakeholder needs and expectations while remaining feasible to implement.

## Overview

Requirements engineering encompasses the entire lifecycle of requirements, from initial discovery through validation, documentation, and ongoing management. It serves as the foundation for all subsequent development activities, bridging the gap between stakeholder needs and technical implementation.

Poor requirements engineering is one of the leading causes of project failure. Studies consistently show that requirements-related issues contribute to cost overruns, schedule delays, and ultimately systems that fail to meet user needs. Conversely, investing in proper requirements engineering yields significant returns through reduced rework, improved stakeholder satisfaction, and more successful project outcomes.

## Key Concepts

### Requirements Fundamentals
- **Functional Requirements**: What the system should do - specific behaviors, features, and capabilities
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: How the system should perform - quality attributes like performance, security, and usability
- **Constraints**: External limitations on design and implementation choices
- **Assumptions**: Conditions presumed to be true that affect requirements

### The Requirements Process
- **Elicitation**: Discovering requirements through various techniques
- **Analysis**: Examining requirements for conflicts, feasibility, and completeness
- **Specification**: Documenting requirements in a clear, structured format
- **Validation**: Ensuring requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs
- **Management**: Maintaining requirements throughout the project lifecycle

### Stakeholder Engagement
- **Identification**: Recognizing all parties affected by or affecting the system
- **Communication**: Establishing effective channels for requirements gathering
- **Negotiation**: Resolving conflicts between competing stakeholder needs
- **Consensus Building**: Achieving agreement on final requirements
