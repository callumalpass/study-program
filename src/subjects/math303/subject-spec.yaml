# ==============================================================================
# PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH
# ==============================================================================

pedagogy:
  knowledge_type: proof-based

  mastery_indicators:
    - Constructs epsilon-delta proofs for limits without guidance
    - Recognizes which proof technique applies to a given statement
    - Correctly uses quantifier order and logical structure in proofs
    - Identifies flaws in incorrect proofs
    - Applies definitions precisely rather than relying on intuition

  common_struggles:
    - Confusing the order of quantifiers (∀ε ∃δ vs ∃δ ∀ε)
    - Treating ε as a specific small number rather than arbitrary
    - Conflating "for all" with "there exists" in negations
    - Relying on pictures/intuition when formal argument is needed
    - Not knowing how to start a proof (which technique to apply)

# ==============================================================================
# CONTENT STANDARDS
# ==============================================================================

content:
  subtopic_requirements:
    - Every definition must be immediately followed by a worked example applying it
    - Include at least one non-example or counterexample per major definition
    - Proof sketches should precede formal proofs for major theorems
    - Explicitly state which proof technique is being used and why
    - Show common errors students make and why they're wrong

  conventions:
    - LaTeX for all mathematical expressions
    - Use ε, δ, N, M consistently (don't mix with epsilon, delta)
    - State theorems formally, then explain in plain language
    - Proofs should begin with "Proof:" and end with □

# ==============================================================================
# ASSESSMENT PHILOSOPHY
# ==============================================================================

assessment:
  philosophy: >
    Proof construction is the core skill. Exams must require students to construct
    proofs, not merely recognize correct ones. Fewer deep problems reveal
    understanding better than many shallow ones. Partial credit for proof structure
    even when conclusion isn't reached.

  measures:
    - Ability to construct valid epsilon-delta proofs
    - Correct application of proof techniques (contradiction, induction, contrapositive)
    - Precise use of mathematical language and quantifiers
    - Recognition of applicable proof strategies

  anti_patterns:
    - Asking students to reproduce specific proofs from the text verbatim
    - Multiple choice questions about proof steps (too easy to guess)
    - Pure computation without justification
    - Questions answerable by pattern-matching rather than understanding

# ==============================================================================
# GRADING THRESHOLDS
# ==============================================================================

grading:
  passing_score: 65

  thresholds:
    exercises: 60
    quizzes: 65
    exams: 60

  rationale: >
    Slightly lower passing threshold than typical because proof-writing has a high
    barrier to entry. A student who can construct 60% of proofs correctly has
    demonstrated significant skill. However, exercises require engagement with the
    material even if proofs aren't perfect.

# ==============================================================================
# EXERCISE SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exercises:
  rationale: >
    Exercises scaffold proof-writing skills. Early exercises provide structure
    ("fill in the gap"), middle exercises require full construction with hints,
    and advanced exercises require choosing the appropriate technique.
    All exercises are written/proof-based since this is pure mathematics.

  types:
    coding_with_tests: "0%"
    coding_ai_evaluated: "0%"
    written: "100%"
    justification: >
      Pure mathematics subject. All exercises are proofs or proof-adjacent
      (finding counterexamples, identifying errors). AI evaluation compares
      student proofs to reference solutions for logical validity.

  per_topic:
    minimum: 10
    target: 12
    maximum: 14
    justification: >
      Fewer than base standard (16) because each proof exercise requires
      substantial time and effort. Quality of engagement matters more than
      volume. 10-14 well-designed proof exercises per topic is sufficient.

  difficulty_distribution:
    1: 1
    2: 2
    3: 4
    4: 3
    5: 2
    justification: >
      Skewed toward medium-hard because proof-writing has a high floor.
      "Easy" proofs still require formal structure. Only 1 difficulty-1
      exercise per topic (typically: verify a definition applies to a
      specific example). Most exercises at difficulty 3-4.

# ==============================================================================
# QUIZ SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

quizzes:
  rationale: >
    Quizzes check definition recall and basic proof structure recognition
    before students attempt full exercises. They build confidence that
    students have the raw material needed for proof construction.

  per_topic:
    count: 2
    questions_each: 6
    justification: >
      Fewer quizzes than base (2 vs 3) but more questions each.
      Conceptual recall doesn't need three separate quizzes.
      Focus on definitions and short-answer rather than full proofs.

  question_types:
    multiple_choice: "35%"
    true_false: "25%"
    fill_blank: "25%"
    code_output: "0%"
    coding: "0%"
    written: "15%"
    justification: >
      Heavy on true/false to address common misconceptions (quantifier order,
      negation errors). Fill-blank for precise definition recall.
      Limited written for short proof fragments (not full proofs—those are exercises).

# ==============================================================================
# EXAM SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exams:
  rationale: >
    Exams require substantial proof construction under time pressure.
    8-12 problems over 2+ hours allows depth. Students should spend
    10-15 minutes per problem. Time pressure tests fluency with techniques.

  midterm:
    questions:
      minimum: 6
      target: 8
      maximum: 10
    duration_minutes: 90
    format: >
      5-6 proof construction problems (15 min each), 2-3 short-answer
      definition/counterexample questions (5 min each). At least one
      problem requiring epsilon-delta argument.
    coverage: "Topics 1-4: Real numbers, sequences, limits, continuity"

  final:
    questions:
      minimum: 10
      target: 12
      maximum: 14
    duration_minutes: 150
    format: >
      8-10 proof construction problems, 2-4 short-answer/definition problems.
      Must include proofs using: epsilon-delta, induction, contradiction.
      At least one problem on each major topic.
    coverage: "Comprehensive: all 7 topics with emphasis on integration topics"
    cumulative: true

# ==============================================================================
# PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

projects:
  required: false
  count: 0
  rationale: >
    Pure math courses traditionally assess via problem sets and exams rather than
    projects. The exercises effectively serve as ongoing "mini-projects" requiring
    extended proof work. No separate projects needed.

# ==============================================================================
# SUBJECT-SPECIFIC RED FLAGS
# ==============================================================================

red_flags:
  - Exercise asks to reproduce a specific proof from the content verbatim
  - Proof in content uses hand-waving ("clearly", "obviously") without justification
  - Quiz question answerable without understanding (e.g., "Is this true or false?" for a standard theorem)
  - Exercise difficulty 1-2 but requires genuine proof construction (should be 3+)
  - Counterexample exercise but no non-examples shown in content
  - Exam question tests computation without requiring justification

# ==============================================================================
# NOTES
# ==============================================================================

notes: >
  Real Analysis is often students' first rigorous proof course. Content should
  acknowledge this transition explicitly. Early topics should spend more time
  on proof technique instruction. The difficulty curve is steep—expect students
  to struggle initially. Content should normalize productive struggle and
  provide many worked examples before asking students to construct proofs independently.
