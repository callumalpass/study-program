title: Introduction to Topology
category: math

role:
  level: advanced
  transformation: >
    From "I know metric space concepts from analysis" to "I understand topological
    spaces as a general framework that abstracts and extends metric space ideas,
    and I can prove fundamental theorems about continuity, connectedness, and
    compactness in this abstract setting."

# ==============================================================================
# PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH
# ==============================================================================

pedagogy:
  knowledge_type: proof-based

  mastery_indicators:
    - Verifies topology axioms for given collections of sets
    - Constructs epsilon-delta style proofs adapted to topological definitions
    - Applies continuity criteria (preimage of open, neighborhood preservation)
    - Identifies and proves when spaces are (not) homeomorphic
    - Uses compactness and connectedness to prove existence results
    - Recognizes which proof technique applies to a given topological statement

  common_struggles:
    - Confusing the topology on a space with the space itself
    - Forgetting that open/closed depends on which topology is being used
    - Applying metric space intuition incorrectly in non-metrizable spaces
    - Confusing "connected" with "path connected"
    - Not recognizing when to use compactness versus sequential compactness
    - Difficulty with quotient topologies and equivalence classes

# ==============================================================================
# CONTENT STANDARDS
# ==============================================================================

content:
  subtopic_requirements:
    - Every definition must include both examples and non-examples
    - Provide intuitive explanations before formal definitions where possible
    - Include diagrams/visualizations for key topological concepts
    - Show the relationship between topological and metric space versions of concepts
    - Explicit counterexamples for common misconceptions

  conventions:
    - LaTeX for all mathematical expressions
    - Use standard notation (tau for topology, cl for closure, int for interior)
    - State theorems formally, then explain in plain language
    - Proofs should begin with "Proof:" and end with a square symbol

# ==============================================================================
# ASSESSMENT PHILOSOPHY
# ==============================================================================

assessment:
  philosophy: >
    Topology requires both conceptual understanding and proof-writing skill.
    Assessments should test the ability to verify definitions, construct proofs,
    identify topological properties, and recognize when spaces are (not) homeomorphic.
    Written proofs should demonstrate logical structure, not just correct conclusions.

  measures:
    - Ability to verify topology axioms and apply definitions
    - Proof construction skills (direct, contradiction, contrapositive)
    - Recognition of topological invariants
    - Application of compactness and connectedness theorems
    - Understanding relationships between different topological properties

  anti_patterns:
    - Questions answerable by memorizing specific proofs from the text
    - True/false without requiring justification for deeper questions
    - Problems that test only metric space concepts (those belong in analysis)
    - Questions about esoteric counterexamples without broader purpose

# ==============================================================================
# GRADING THRESHOLDS
# ==============================================================================

grading:
  passing_score: 65

  thresholds:
    exercises: 60
    quizzes: 65
    exams: 60

  rationale: >
    Lower passing threshold than typical because topology has a steep learning
    curve and proof construction is difficult. A student who successfully proves
    60% of problems has demonstrated significant mathematical maturity. Focus
    should be on depth of understanding rather than percentage of correct answers.

# ==============================================================================
# EXERCISE SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exercises:
  rationale: >
    Exercises scaffold proof-writing in the topological context. Early exercises
    verify definitions and apply basic concepts. Later exercises require full
    proof construction, identifying topological properties, and recognizing
    homeomorphisms. All exercises are proof-based or proof-adjacent.

  types:
    coding_with_tests: "0%"
    coding_ai_evaluated: "0%"
    written: "100%"
    justification: >
      Pure mathematics subject. All exercises involve proofs, counterexample
      construction, or verification of topological properties. AI evaluation
      compares student proofs to reference solutions for logical validity.

  per_topic:
    minimum: 14
    target: 16
    maximum: 18
    justification: >
      Standard count. Each exercise requires substantial thought but topology
      exercises can be more diverse than pure analysis exercises. Mix of
      verification, proof, and counterexample exercises.

  difficulty_distribution:
    1: 2
    2: 4
    3: 5
    4: 3
    5: 2
    justification: >
      Skewed toward medium difficulty. Even "easy" topology problems require
      proof structure. Difficulty 1-2 exercises verify definitions or find
      simple examples. Difficulty 4-5 require novel proof construction or
      identifying subtle distinctions.

# ==============================================================================
# QUIZ SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

quizzes:
  rationale: >
    Quizzes test conceptual understanding, definition recall, and basic proof
    recognition. They ensure students understand the definitions and can identify
    correct applications before attempting full exercises.

  per_topic:
    count: 3
    questions_each: 5
    justification: >
      Standard count. Three quizzes per topic allows progression from definitions
      (Quiz A) to applications (Quiz B) to deeper understanding (Quiz C).

  question_types:
    multiple_choice: "60%"
    true_false: "30%"
    fill_blank: "0%"
    code_output: "0%"
    coding: "0%"
    written: "10%"
    justification: >
      Multiple choice for conceptual understanding and recognizing correct
      statements. True/false for addressing misconceptions (with required
      explanation in some cases). Limited written for short justifications.

# ==============================================================================
# EXAM SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exams:
  rationale: >
    Exams test proof construction and conceptual understanding under time
    pressure. Mix of shorter verification problems and longer proof construction.
    Students should demonstrate mastery of definitions and ability to construct
    novel proofs using course techniques.

  midterm:
    questions:
      minimum: 24
      target: 26
      maximum: 30
    duration_minutes: 90
    format: >
      Mix of multiple choice (8-10), true/false (4-6), and written proofs (6-8).
      Written questions include definition verification, short proofs, and
      one or two longer proof constructions.
    coverage: "Topics 1-4: Topological Spaces, Bases, Continuity, Connectedness"

  final:
    questions:
      minimum: 38
      target: 42
      maximum: 48
    duration_minutes: 120
    format: >
      Mix of multiple choice (14-16), true/false (8-10), and written proofs (10-14).
      Comprehensive coverage with emphasis on compactness, metric spaces, and
      applications. At least two longer proof construction problems.
    coverage: "Comprehensive: all 7 topics with emphasis on later material"
    cumulative: true

# ==============================================================================
# PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

projects:
  required: false
  count: 0
  rationale: >
    Pure mathematics courses traditionally assess via problem sets and exams
    rather than projects. The exercises serve as ongoing proof practice.
    No separate projects needed for a topology course.

# ==============================================================================
# SUBJECT-SPECIFIC RED FLAGS
# ==============================================================================

red_flags:
  - Exercise asks to reproduce a specific proof from the content verbatim
  - Question tests metric space concepts without topological generalization
  - Content uses "clearly" or "obviously" without justification
  - Counterexample exercise but no non-examples shown in content
  - Question relies on knowledge of specific spaces not covered in course
  - True/false question about deep theorem without requiring justification

# ==============================================================================
# NOTES
# ==============================================================================

notes: >
  Topology requires a shift in thinking from metric to abstract spaces. Content
  should frequently contrast topological definitions with metric space versions
  students already know. Early topics should move slowly, building intuition
  before formalism. Later topics can move faster as students develop topological
  maturity. Emphasize that many spaces students know (real line, plane, sphere)
  are studied from a new perspective, not replaced by abstract nonsense.
