# Covering Spaces

Covering spaces provide a powerful tool for studying the fundamental group and classifying spaces with the same local structure but different global topology. A covering space is a topological space that "wraps around" a base space multiple times in a locally homeomorphic way, like how the real line $\mathbb{R}$ wraps infinitely around the circle $S^1$ via the exponential map. Covering space theory reveals the deep connection between topology and algebra, showing how the fundamental group controls which spaces can cover a given space. This theory has profound applications in complex analysis (Riemann surfaces), algebraic geometry, differential geometry, and group theory. Understanding covering spaces is essential for computing fundamental groups and studying the global structure of topological spaces.

## Definition

The concept of a covering space formalizes the idea of one space "covering" another with multiple sheets.

**Definition:** A **covering map** (or **covering projection**) is a continuous surjection $p: \tilde{X} \to X$ satisfying the **local homeomorphism property**: every point $x \in X$ has an open neighborhood $U \subseteq X$ (called an **evenly covered neighborhood**) such that $p^{-1}(U)$ is a disjoint union of open sets in $\tilde{X}$:
$$p^{-1}(U) = \bigsqcup_{\alpha \in A} V_\alpha$$
where each restriction $p|_{V_\alpha}: V_\alpha \to U$ is a homeomorphism.

**Terminology:**
- $\tilde{X}$ is the **covering space**
- $X$ is the **base space**
- The sets $V_\alpha$ are called **sheets** over U
- The cardinality $|A|$ is the number of sheets over U

**Intuition:** Locally, p looks like a projection from multiple identical copies of U stacked above the base U. Each sheet maps homeomorphically onto U, but globally the sheets may connect in complex ways.

**Key property:** Covering maps are local homeomorphisms, but global topology can differ dramatically between $\tilde{X}$ and X.

## Examples

Examples illustrate the diversity and richness of covering spaces.

### Example 1: The Circle

The covering map $p: \mathbb{R} \to S^1$ given by $p(t) = e^{2\pi i t}$ is the fundamental example.

**Properties:**
- Every point $z \in S^1$ has infinitely many preimages: $p^{-1}(z) = \{t \in \mathbb{R} : e^{2\pi i t} = z\} = \{\text{arg}(z)/2\pi + n : n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$
- This is the **universal cover** of $S^1$ (the unique simply connected cover)
- The "fibers" $p^{-1}(z)$ are discrete sets (0-dimensional)
- The deck transformation group is $\mathbb{Z}$ acting by integer translations: $t \mapsto t + n$

**Visualization:** The real line spirals infinitely around the circle, with each integer interval $[n, n+1]$ wrapping once around $S^1$.

### Example 2: n-fold Cover of the Circle

The map $p_n: S^1 \to S^1$ given by $p_n(z) = z^n$ is an n-fold covering.

**Properties:**
- Each point has exactly n preimages (the n-th roots)
- This corresponds to the subgroup $n\mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \cong \pi_1(S^1)$
- The deck transformation group is $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ (cyclic group of order n)
- As n varies, we obtain all finite-sheeted coverings of $S^1$

### Example 3: Real Projective Space

The antipodal map $p: S^n \to \mathbb{RP}^n$ given by $p(x) = [x]$ (equivalence class) is a 2-fold covering.

**Properties:**
- Each point $[x] \in \mathbb{RP}^n$ has exactly 2 preimages: $\{x, -x\} \subseteq S^n$
- $S^n$ is the universal cover of $\mathbb{RP}^n$ (for $n \geq 2$)
- The deck transformation group is $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ generated by the antipodal map $x \mapsto -x$
- This reflects $\pi_1(\mathbb{RP}^n) \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ for $n \geq 2$

### Example 4: The Torus

The map $p: \mathbb{R}^2 \to T^2$ given by $p(x,y) = (e^{2\pi ix}, e^{2\pi iy})$ is a covering map.

**Properties:**
- $\mathbb{R}^2$ is the universal cover of the torus $T^2 = S^1 \times S^1$
- The fiber over each point is the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2 \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$
- The deck transformation group is $\mathbb{Z}^2$ acting by translations: $(x,y) \mapsto (x+m, y+n)$
- This corresponds to $\pi_1(T^2) \cong \mathbb{Z}^2$

**Alternative description:** $T^2 = \mathbb{R}^2 / \mathbb{Z}^2$ (quotient by integer lattice).

### Example 5: The Figure-Eight

The universal cover of $S^1 \vee S^1$ (wedge of two circles) is an infinite 4-valent tree.

**Properties:**
- The tree has vertices of degree 4
- Each edge corresponds to one of the two circle factors
- The deck transformation group is the free group $\mathbb{Z} * \mathbb{Z} \cong \pi_1(S^1 \vee S^1)$
- This visualizes the fundamental group geometrically as symmetries of the tree

## Lifting Properties

Lifting theorems are the key technical tools in covering space theory, determining when maps can be "lifted" to the covering space.

**Theorem (Path Lifting Property):** Let $p: \tilde{X} \to X$ be a covering map. Given:
- A path $\gamma: [0,1] \to X$ in the base space
- A point $\tilde{x}_0 \in \tilde{X}$ with $p(\tilde{x}_0) = \gamma(0)$

There exists a **unique** lift $\tilde{\gamma}: [0,1] \to \tilde{X}$ with:
- $p \circ \tilde{\gamma} = \gamma$ (lifts γ)
- $\tilde{\gamma}(0) = \tilde{x}_0$ (starts at the specified point)

**Proof idea:** Partition [0,1] into small intervals, each mapped into an evenly covered neighborhood. Lift step-by-step, using uniqueness of local lifts.

**Consequence:** The endpoint $\tilde{\gamma}(1)$ depends only on the homotopy class of $\gamma$ (rel endpoints). This gives the monodromy action of $\pi_1(X)$ on fibers.

**Theorem (Homotopy Lifting Property):** Given a covering $p: \tilde{X} \to X$, a homotopy $H: Y \times [0,1] \to X$, and a lift $\tilde{H}_0: Y \to \tilde{X}$ of $H_0 = H(\cdot, 0)$, there exists a **unique** homotopy lift $\tilde{H}: Y \times [0,1] \to \tilde{X}$ with:
- $p \circ \tilde{H} = H$
- $\tilde{H}(\cdot, 0) = \tilde{H}_0$

**Corollary:** Path homotopies lift to path homotopies. This is crucial for defining the action of $\pi_1$ on fibers.

**Theorem (General Lifting Criterion):** Let $p: \tilde{X} \to X$ be a covering, $f: Y \to X$ a continuous map, and $y_0 \in Y$, $\tilde{x}_0 \in \tilde{X}$ with $p(\tilde{x}_0) = f(y_0)$. A lift $\tilde{f}: Y \to \tilde{X}$ with $p \circ \tilde{f} = f$ and $\tilde{f}(y_0) = \tilde{x}_0$ exists if and only if:
$$f_*(\pi_1(Y, y_0)) \subseteq p_*(\pi_1(\tilde{X}, \tilde{x}_0))$$

**Interpretation:** A map lifts if and only if its fundamental group image lies within the image of the covering space's fundamental group. This algebraic condition determines a topological property.

**Application:** This criterion determines when maps between spaces can be lifted to covering spaces, essential for constructing maps and studying their properties.

## The Monodromy Action

The monodromy action connects covering spaces to the fundamental group.

**Definition:** For a covering $p: \tilde{X} \to X$ with basepoint $x_0 \in X$, the **monodromy action** of $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ on the fiber $F = p^{-1}(x_0)$ is defined by:
$$[\gamma] \cdot \tilde{x} = \tilde{\gamma}(1)$$
where $\tilde{\gamma}$ is the unique lift of loop $\gamma$ starting at $\tilde{x} \in F$.

**Properties:**
- This defines a group action $\pi_1(X, x_0) \times F \to F$
- The action is **transitive** if $\tilde{X}$ is path-connected
- The **stabilizer** of $\tilde{x}_0$ (elements acting trivially) equals $p_*(\pi_1(\tilde{X}, \tilde{x}_0))$

**Theorem (Orbit-Stabilizer):** For path-connected $\tilde{X}$:
$$|F| = [\pi_1(X) : p_*(\pi_1(\tilde{X}))]$$

The number of sheets equals the index of the image of the fundamental group.

**Example:** For $\mathbb{R} \to S^1$, the fiber is $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\pi_1(S^1) = \mathbb{Z}$ acts by translation. The stabilizer is $\{0\}$ (trivial subgroup), so the index is infinite, matching the infinite number of sheets.

## Classification of Covering Spaces

The classification theorem is the crown jewel of covering space theory, establishing a perfect correspondence between subgroups and coverings.

**Theorem (Classification of Covering Spaces):** Let X be a path-connected, locally path-connected, and semi-locally simply connected space (these conditions ensure X has a universal cover). Fix basepoint $x_0 \in X$.

There is a bijective correspondence:
$$\{\text{Isomorphism classes of path-connected coverings of } X\} \leftrightarrow \{\text{Subgroups of } \pi_1(X, x_0)\}$$

given by:
$$p: \tilde{X} \to X \quad \mapsto \quad H = p_*(\pi_1(\tilde{X}, \tilde{x}_0))$$

**Properties of the correspondence:**
1. **Subgroup determines covering:** The covering space corresponding to subgroup $H \subseteq \pi_1(X)$ has $\pi_1(\tilde{X}) \cong H$
2. **Number of sheets:** The number of sheets equals $[\pi_1(X) : H]$ (index of H)
3. **Normal subgroups:** H is normal in $\pi_1(X)$ if and only if the covering is **regular** (or **normal** or **Galois**)
4. **Deck transformations:** For normal coverings, $\text{Deck}(\tilde{X}/X) \cong \pi_1(X) / H$

**Example—Circle:** Subgroups of $\pi_1(S^1) = \mathbb{Z}$ are $n\mathbb{Z}$ for $n \geq 0$:
- $n = 0$: Trivial subgroup $\Rightarrow$ universal cover $\mathbb{R} \to S^1$
- $n = 1$: Whole group $\Rightarrow$ identity covering $S^1 \to S^1$
- $n > 1$: Subgroup $n\mathbb{Z} \Rightarrow$ n-fold covering $z \mapsto z^n$

**Significance:** This theorem converts the topological problem of classifying coverings into the algebraic problem of classifying subgroups. For spaces with known fundamental group, we understand all possible covering spaces.

## The Universal Cover

The universal cover is the "largest" and "most unwrapped" covering space.

**Definition:** A **universal cover** of X is a simply connected covering space $\tilde{X} \to X$.

**Theorem (Existence and Uniqueness):** If X is path-connected, locally path-connected, and semi-locally simply connected, then:
1. X has a universal cover (existence)
2. The universal cover is unique up to isomorphism (uniqueness)

**Properties:**
- The universal cover corresponds to the trivial subgroup $\{e\} \subseteq \pi_1(X)$
- $\pi_1(\tilde{X}) = \{e\}$ (simply connected)
- Every other connected covering space is a quotient of the universal cover
- The number of sheets is $[\pi_1(X) : \{e\}] = |\pi_1(X)|$ (cardinality of fundamental group)

**Examples:**
- Universal cover of $S^1$: $\mathbb{R} \to S^1$
- Universal cover of $T^n$: $\mathbb{R}^n \to T^n$
- Universal cover of $\mathbb{RP}^n$ (n ≥ 2): $S^n \to \mathbb{RP}^n$
- Universal cover of $S^1 \vee S^1$: infinite 4-valent tree
- Universal cover of a closed orientable surface of genus g ≥ 2: hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$

**Non-examples:** Spaces without universal covers include:
- The Hawaiian earring (fails semi-local simple connectivity)
- The cone on the Hawaiian earring (same issue)

**Application:** The universal cover provides a simply connected space with the same local structure as X, often easier to understand.

## Deck Transformations

Deck transformations are the symmetries of a covering space.

**Definition:** A **deck transformation** (or **covering transformation** or **covering automorphism**) is a homeomorphism $\phi: \tilde{X} \to \tilde{X}$ satisfying:
$$p \circ \phi = p$$

In other words, $\phi$ permutes the sheets of the covering while respecting the projection.

**Theorem:** The set $\text{Deck}(\tilde{X}/X)$ of all deck transformations forms a group under composition.

**Properties:**
- Deck transformations act freely and properly discontinuously on $\tilde{X}$
- If $\tilde{X}$ is path-connected, deck transformations are determined by where they send a single point
- The deck transformation group acts on fibers, often transitively

**Theorem (Normal/Regular Coverings):** A path-connected covering $p: \tilde{X} \to X$ is **normal** (or **regular** or **Galois**) if and only if the deck transformation group acts transitively on fibers. This occurs if and only if $p_*(\pi_1(\tilde{X}))$ is a normal subgroup of $\pi_1(X)$.

For normal coverings:
$$\text{Deck}(\tilde{X}/X) \cong \pi_1(X) / p_*(\pi_1(\tilde{X}))$$

**Corollary (Universal Cover):** For the universal cover:
$$\text{Deck}(\tilde{X}/X) \cong \pi_1(X)$$

This provides a geometric realization of the fundamental group as symmetries of the universal cover.

**Example—Circle:** The deck transformations of $\mathbb{R} \to S^1$ are integer translations $t \mapsto t + n$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, forming the group $\mathbb{Z} \cong \pi_1(S^1)$.

**Example—Torus:** The deck transformations of $\mathbb{R}^2 \to T^2$ are integer lattice translations $(x,y) \mapsto (x+m, y+n)$, forming $\mathbb{Z}^2 \cong \pi_1(T^2)$.

## Applications

### Galois Theory Analogy

Covering space theory parallels Galois theory for fields, with remarkable analogies:

| **Galois Theory** | **Covering Space Theory** |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Field extensions | Covering spaces |
| Galois group | Deck transformation group |
| Normal extensions | Regular coverings |
| Fundamental theorem | Classification theorem |
| Algebraic closure | Universal cover |

This analogy runs deep and has inspired **Grothendieck's Galois theory** generalizing both.

### Computing Fundamental Groups

Covering spaces enable fundamental group computations:

**Strategy:**
1. Find a simply connected covering space $\tilde{X}$ of X
2. Determine the deck transformation group
3. Conclude $\pi_1(X) \cong \text{Deck}(\tilde{X}/X)$

**Example:** For $\mathbb{RP}^2$, the universal cover is $S^2$ with deck transformation group $\{\pm \text{id}\} \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, so $\pi_1(\mathbb{RP}^2) \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$.

### Existence of Maps

The lifting criterion determines when maps exist:

**Problem:** Can we extend a map defined on a subspace? Lift a map to a covering space?

**Solution:** Check the algebraic condition on fundamental groups.

**Example:** A map $S^2 \to X$ extends to $D^3$ if and only if it's null-homotopic, which can be checked using $\pi_1$ and covering spaces.

### Complex Analysis—Riemann Surfaces

Covering spaces are fundamental in complex analysis:
- **Analytic continuation:** Multi-valued functions (like $\sqrt{z}$ or $\log z$) become single-valued on appropriate covering spaces
- **Riemann surfaces:** Natural domains for multi-valued holomorphic functions
- **Modular forms:** Understand via coverings of moduli spaces

**Example:** The complex logarithm $\log: \mathbb{C}^* \to \mathbb{C}$ corresponds to the universal cover $\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}^* = \mathbb{C} \setminus \{0\}$ via $z \mapsto e^z$.
