# Applications of Connectedness

## Introduction

Connectedness is not just an abstract topological property - it has powerful applications throughout mathematics. This section explores how connectedness is used to prove important theorems in analysis, algebra, and geometry.

## Intermediate Value Theorem

The classic application of connectedness is the Intermediate Value Theorem from calculus.

**Theorem 7.1 (Intermediate Value Theorem):** Let $f: [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous. If $c$ is between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then there exists $x \in [a, b]$ with $f(x) = c$.

**Proof:** The interval $[a, b]$ is connected. Since $f$ is continuous, $f([a, b])$ is a connected subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Connected subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are intervals. Since $f(a), f(b) \in f([a, b])$ and $f([a, b])$ is an interval, any value between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ is also in $f([a, b])$. $\square$

**Application 7.1 (Roots of Polynomials):** Every odd-degree polynomial $p: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ has at least one real root.

**Proof:** Let $p(x) = a_nx^n + \cdots + a_0$ with $n$ odd and $a_n > 0$. Then:
$$\lim_{x \to -\infty} p(x) = -\infty, \quad \lim_{x \to +\infty} p(x) = +\infty$$

Choose $M$ large enough that $p(-M) < 0$ and $p(M) > 0$. By the IVT, there exists $r \in (-M, M)$ with $p(r) = 0$. $\square$

## Fixed Point Theorems

**Theorem 7.2 (One-Dimensional Brouwer Fixed Point):** Every continuous function $f: [0, 1] \to [0, 1]$ has a fixed point.

**Proof:** Define $g: [0, 1] \to \mathbb{R}$ by $g(x) = f(x) - x$. Then:
$$g(0) = f(0) \geq 0, \quad g(1) = f(1) - 1 \leq 0$$

If $g(0) = 0$, then $f(0) = 0$ is a fixed point. If $g(1) = 0$, then $f(1) = 1$ is a fixed point. Otherwise, $g(0) > 0$ and $g(1) < 0$, so by the IVT (connectedness of $[0,1]$), there exists $c \in (0, 1)$ with $g(c) = 0$, meaning $f(c) = c$. $\square$

**Generalization:** Brouwer's fixed point theorem holds in all dimensions: any continuous $f: D^n \to D^n$ (where $D^n$ is the closed unit ball) has a fixed point. The proof uses algebraic topology but relies fundamentally on connectedness.

## Preservation of Connectedness

**Application 7.2 (No Homeomorphism):** Connectedness can be used to show two spaces are not homeomorphic.

**Example 7.1:** $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$ are not homeomorphic.

**Proof:** $\mathbb{R}$ is connected, but $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$ is disconnected (two components). Connectedness is preserved by homeomorphisms, so no homeomorphism exists. $\square$

**Example 7.2:** $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}^2$ are not homeomorphic.

**Proof:** Removing a point from $\mathbb{R}$ gives a disconnected space (two components), but removing a point from $\mathbb{R}^2$ leaves a connected space. This property is preserved by homeomorphisms (up to point removal), so $\mathbb{R} \not\cong \mathbb{R}^2$. $\square$

## Path Connectedness Applications

**Application 7.3 (Homotopy Theory):** Path-connectedness is fundamental for defining the fundamental group $\pi_1(X)$, which measures "holes" in a space.

**Application 7.4 (Covering Spaces):** The theory of covering spaces relies heavily on path-connectedness and its relationship to lifting properties.

## Applications to Analysis

**Theorem 7.3 (Mean Value Theorem for Integrals):** If $f: [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous, then there exists $c \in [a, b]$ such that:
$$\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = f(c)(b - a)$$

**Proof:** By the extreme value theorem (which uses compactness), $f$ attains its minimum $m$ and maximum $M$ on $[a, b]$. We have:
$$m(b-a) \leq \int_a^b f(x) \, dx \leq M(b-a)$$

Therefore:
$$m \leq \frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^b f(x) \, dx \leq M$$

By the IVT (connectedness), there exists $c$ with $f(c)$ equal to the average value. $\square$

**Application 7.5 (Rolle's Theorem):** If $f: [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable with $f(a) = f(b)$, then $f'(c) = 0$ for some $c \in (a, b)$.

The proof uses the extreme value theorem and connectedness to find critical points.

## Applications to Algebra

**Application 7.6 (Topological Groups):** A connected topological group $G$ is generated by any neighborhood of the identity.

**Proof Sketch:** The union of all powers of a neighborhood $U$ is both open (union of open sets via multiplication) and closed (by algebraic properties), hence equals $G$ by connectedness. $\square$

**Application 7.7 (Path-Connected Implies Generated):** In a path-connected topological group, any neighborhood of the identity generates the whole group.

## Connectedness and Compactness

**Theorem 7.4:** The continuous image of a connected compact space is connected and compact.

This combines two fundamental properties. Applications:

**Application 7.8 (Extreme Value Theorem):** A continuous function $f: K \to \mathbb{R}$ where $K$ is compact attains its maximum and minimum.

**Proof:** $f(K)$ is compact in $\mathbb{R}$, hence closed and bounded. Being closed and bounded in $\mathbb{R}$ means it contains its supremum and infimum, so $f$ attains its max and min. $\square$

## Applications to Geometry

**Application 7.9 (Jordan Curve Theorem):** A simple closed curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$ divides the plane into exactly two connected components (interior and exterior).

This deep theorem relies on connectedness and homology theory.

**Application 7.10 (Invariance of Domain):** If $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is open and $f: U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is a continuous injection, then $f(U)$ is open and $f$ is a homeomorphism onto its image.

This uses connectedness combined with algebraic topology.

## Connectedness in Metric Spaces

**Proposition 7.1:** In $\mathbb{R}^n$, a set is connected if and only if it is path-connected.

**Proof Sketch:** Path-connected implies connected (we've proved this). For the converse, use that $\mathbb{R}^n$ is locally path-connected: connected open sets are path-connected, and general connected sets can be covered by path-connected pieces. $\square$

**Application 7.11:** This equivalence makes checking connectedness in $\mathbb{R}^n$ much easier - just verify path-connectedness.

## Summary of Applications

Key applications of connectedness:

1. **Intermediate Value Theorem:** Existence of roots and intermediate values
2. **Fixed Point Theorems:** Brouwer fixed point theorem
3. **Distinguishing Spaces:** Proving non-homeomorphism
4. **Analysis:** Mean value theorems, extreme value theorem
5. **Algebra:** Topological groups, generation properties
6. **Geometry:** Jordan curve theorem, invariance of domain
7. **Simplification:** In $\mathbb{R}^n$, connected = path-connected

Connectedness is one of the most applicable topological concepts, with ramifications throughout mathematics. Its power comes from providing a topological way to prove existence results (like the IVT) that would be difficult or impossible without topology.

## Advanced Applications

**Application 7.12 (Algebraic Geometry):** The Zariski topology on varieties uses connectedness to study geometric properties of solution sets to polynomial equations.

**Application 7.13 (Complex Analysis):** The identity theorem (if two holomorphic functions agree on a set with a limit point, they agree everywhere on a connected domain) relies on connectedness.

**Application 7.14 (Differential Topology):** Connectedness of Lie groups and manifolds is fundamental for understanding their global structure.

These applications demonstrate that connectedness, while defined abstractly, is indispensable for concrete mathematical problems across many fields.
