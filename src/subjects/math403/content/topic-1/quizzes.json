          "{∅, {a}, {a, b}, X}",
          "{∅, {a}, {b}, X}",

        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "A topology must contain ∅ and X, and be closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections. {∅, {a}, {a, b}, X} satisfies all requirements: {a} ∪ {a, b} = {a, b} ✓, {a} ∩ {a, b} = {a} ✓. The other options fail: {∅, {a}, {b}, X} fails because {a} ∪ {b} = {a,b} is not in the collection; {∅, {a}, {b}, {a, b}} is missing X; {∅, X} is the indiscrete topology but not the question's answer."

        "correctAnswer": 3,
        "explanation": "The first three options are all equivalent definitions of a closed set. However, 'F contains at least one limit point' is not a valid definition - a closed set must contain ALL its limit points, not just one. Additionally, finite sets in discrete spaces are closed but may have no limit points."
