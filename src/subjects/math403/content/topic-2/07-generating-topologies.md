# Generating Topologies

## Introduction

There are many ways to construct a topology on a set. We can start with a basis, a subbasis, a metric, a collection of functions, or other structures. This section synthesizes the various methods for generating topologies and explores their relationships. Understanding these construction methods is crucial for working flexibly with topological spaces.

## Summary of Generation Methods

We've seen several methods to generate a topology on a set $X$:

1. **From a basis:** $\mathcal{T} = \{\bigcup_\alpha B_\alpha : B_\alpha \in \mathcal{B}\}$
2. **From a subbasis:** First form the basis of finite intersections, then take unions
3. **From a metric:** Open sets are those where every point has an open ball contained in the set
4. **From functions:** Initial topology making certain functions continuous

Each method has different requirements and produces topologies with different properties.

## Generating from a Basis

**Method 1 (Direct Specification):** Given a collection $\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $X$ satisfying:
- B1: $\bigcup_{B \in \mathcal{B}} B = X$
- B2: For $B_1, B_2 \in \mathcal{B}$ and $x \in B_1 \cap B_2$, there exists $B_3 \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in B_3 \subseteq B_1 \cap B_2$

Define: $\mathcal{T} = \{\bigcup_{\alpha} B_\alpha : B_\alpha \in \mathcal{B}\}$

This is a topology with basis $\mathcal{B}$.

**Example:** On $\mathbb{R}^2$, the collection of all open rectangles $(a, b) \times (c, d)$ generates the standard topology.

## Generating from a Subbasis

**Method 2 (Subbasis):** Given any collection $\mathcal{S}$ of subsets with $\bigcup_{S \in \mathcal{S}} S = X$:

**Step 1:** Form $\mathcal{B} = \{\bigcap_{i=1}^n S_i : S_i \in \mathcal{S}, n \geq 1\} \cup \{X\}$

**Step 2:** Define $\mathcal{T} = \{\bigcup_\alpha B_\alpha : B_\alpha \in \mathcal{B}\}$

This is the **topology generated by $\mathcal{S}$**, the coarsest topology containing all sets in $\mathcal{S}$.

**Advantage:** No intersection property required (only coverage)

**Example:** On $\mathbb{R}$, the collection $\{(a, \infty), (-\infty, b) : a, b \in \mathbb{R}\}$ generates the standard topology.

## Generating from a Metric

**Method 3 (Metric Topology):** Given a metric $d: X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying:
- $d(x, y) \geq 0$ with equality iff $x = y$
- $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$
- $d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)$

Define the **metric topology** via the basis:
$$\mathcal{B} = \{B(x, r) : x \in X, r > 0\}$$

where $B(x, r) = \{y : d(x, y) < r\}$.

**Properties:**
- Always Hausdorff
- Always first-countable (countable local basis at each point)
- Metrizable spaces have nice properties (separable, paracompact, etc.)

**Example:** Euclidean metric on $\mathbb{R}^n$ generates the standard topology.

## Initial Topology

**Method 4 (Initial Topology):** Given a family of functions $\{f_\alpha: X \to Y_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in I}$ where each $Y_\alpha$ has a topology:

Define the **initial topology** on $X$ as the coarsest topology making all $f_\alpha$ continuous.

**Subbasis:** $\mathcal{S} = \{f_\alpha^{-1}(U) : \alpha \in I, U \text{ open in } Y_\alpha\}$

**Properties:**
- Makes all $f_\alpha$ continuous
- Universal property: Any function $g: Z \to X$ is continuous iff $f_\alpha \circ g$ is continuous for all $\alpha$

**Examples:**

1. **Subspace topology:** For $Y \subseteq X$ and inclusion $i: Y \to X$, the initial topology on $Y$ is the subspace topology

2. **Product topology:** For projections $\pi_\alpha: \prod_\beta X_\beta \to X_\alpha$, the initial topology is the product topology

3. **Weak topology:** In functional analysis, the weak topology on a vector space $V$ is the initial topology from the dual space $V^*$

## Final Topology

**Method 5 (Final Topology):** Given a family of functions $\{f_\alpha: Y_\alpha \to X\}_{\alpha \in I}$ where each $Y_\alpha$ has a topology:

Define the **final topology** on $X$ as the finest topology making all $f_\alpha$ continuous.

**Explicitly:** $U \subseteq X$ is open iff $f_\alpha^{-1}(U)$ is open in $Y_\alpha$ for all $\alpha$.

**Properties:**
- Makes all $f_\alpha$ continuous
- Universal property: Any function $g: X \to Z$ is continuous iff $g \circ f_\alpha$ is continuous for all $\alpha$

**Examples:**

1. **Quotient topology:** For quotient map $\pi: X \to X/\sim$, the final topology on $X/\sim$ is the quotient topology

2. **Disjoint union topology:** For injections $i_\alpha: X_\alpha \to \bigsqcup_\alpha X_\alpha$, the final topology is the disjoint union topology

3. **Direct limit topology:** In algebraic topology, direct limits of spaces have the final topology

## Comparing Generation Methods

**Theorem 7.1 (Comparison):** Let $\mathcal{T}_1$ be the topology generated by subbasis $\mathcal{S}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ by subbasis $\mathcal{S}_2$. Then:

$$\mathcal{S}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2 \implies \mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$$

In other words, if all subbasis elements of $\mathcal{S}_1$ are open in $\mathcal{T}_2$, then $\mathcal{T}_1$ is coarser than $\mathcal{T}_2$.

**Proof:** Since $\mathcal{S}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ is closed under finite intersections and arbitrary unions, all sets in $\mathcal{T}_1$ (which are unions of finite intersections of sets in $\mathcal{S}_1$) are in $\mathcal{T}_2$. $\square$

**Application:** This gives a method to compare topologies: find subbases and check inclusion.

## Coarsest and Finest Topologies

Given a collection $\mathcal{C}$ of subsets of $X$:

**Coarsest topology containing $\mathcal{C}$:** The subbasis-generated topology with $\mathcal{S} = \mathcal{C}$

**Finest topology contained in $\mathcal{C}$:** Generally doesn't exist (unless $\mathcal{C}$ is already a topology)

**Example:** The coarsest topology making functions $f_1, \ldots, f_n: X \to Y$ continuous is the initial topology with subbasis $\{f_i^{-1}(U) : U \text{ open in } Y\}$.

## Closure Operator Approach

**Method 6 (Kuratowski Axioms):** Define a closure operator $\text{cl}: \mathcal{P}(X) \to \mathcal{P}(X)$ satisfying:

1. $\text{cl}(\emptyset) = \emptyset$
2. $A \subseteq \text{cl}(A)$
3. $\text{cl}(\text{cl}(A)) = \text{cl}(A)$
4. $\text{cl}(A \cup B) = \text{cl}(A) \cup \text{cl}(B)$

Then there's a unique topology where $\text{cl}(A)$ is the closure of $A$.

**Explicitly:** Define $\mathcal{T} = \{U : \text{cl}(X \setminus U) = X \setminus U\}$

This generates a topology where the closure operator is the given one.

## Neighborhood System Approach

**Method 7 (Neighborhood Axioms):** For each $x \in X$, specify a collection $\mathcal{N}(x)$ of "neighborhoods" satisfying:

1. If $N \in \mathcal{N}(x)$, then $x \in N$
2. If $N \in \mathcal{N}(x)$ and $N \subseteq M$, then $M \in \mathcal{N}(x)$
3. If $N_1, N_2 \in \mathcal{N}(x)$, then $N_1 \cap N_2 \in \mathcal{N}(x)$
4. If $N \in \mathcal{N}(x)$, there exists $M \in \mathcal{N}(x)$ such that $N \in \mathcal{N}(y)$ for all $y \in M$

Then there's a unique topology where $\mathcal{N}(x)$ is the neighborhood system at $x$.

**Explicitly:** $U$ is open iff $U \in \mathcal{N}(x)$ for all $x \in U$.

## Convergence Approach

**Method 8 (Filters/Nets):** Specify which filters or nets converge to which points, subject to axioms. This determines a topology.

This is more advanced and used in functional analysis and general topology.

## Examples of Multiple Generation Methods

**Example 7.1 ($\mathbb{R}$ with Standard Topology):**

Can be generated by:
- **Basis:** All open intervals $(a, b)$
- **Subbasis:** All rays $(a, \infty)$ and $(-\infty, b)$
- **Metric:** Euclidean metric $d(x, y) = |x - y|$
- **Order:** Order topology from the usual order $<$

All give the same topology!

**Example 7.2 (Product $\mathbb{R}^2$):**

Can be generated by:
- **Basis:** All open rectangles $(a, b) \times (c, d)$
- **Subbasis:** All "vertical slabs" $U \times \mathbb{R}$ and "horizontal slabs" $\mathbb{R} \times V$
- **Metric:** Euclidean metric $d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2}$
- **Product:** Product topology on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$

Again, all give the same topology!

**Example 7.3 (Sorgenfrey Line):**

On $\mathbb{R}$:
- **Basis:** All half-open intervals $[a, b)$
- **Subbasis:** All $[a, \infty)$ and $(-\infty, b)$
- **Not metrizable!** (Cannot be generated by any metric)

This shows some topologies require specific generation methods.

## When Do Different Methods Give the Same Topology?

**Theorem 7.2 (Metrization):** A topology is metrizable (generated by some metric) iff it's:
- Regular (a separation property)
- Hausdorff
- Second-countable (has a countable basis)

**Urysohn Metrization Theorem:** Regular + Hausdorff + second-countable $\implies$ metrizable

**Theorem 7.3 (Subspace = Initial):** For $Y \subseteq X$ with inclusion $i: Y \to X$, the initial topology from $i$ equals the subspace topology.

**Theorem 7.4 (Product = Initial):** The product topology on $\prod_\alpha X_\alpha$ equals the initial topology from the projections $\pi_\alpha$.

## Practical Considerations

**When to use each method:**

| Method | Use when | Advantage |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Basis | Natural "basic open sets" exist | Direct and intuitive |
| Subbasis | Simple sets that don't form basis | Minimal description |
| Metric | Distance makes sense | Analysis tools available |
| Initial | Defining via functions | Universal property |
| Final | Gluing spaces together | Quotients, direct limits |

## Summary

Key points about generating topologies:

1. **Multiple methods:** Basis, subbasis, metric, initial, final, closure, neighborhoods
2. **Coarsest/finest:** Initial topology is coarsest, final is finest
3. **Comparison:** Use subbasis inclusion to compare topologies
4. **Examples:** $\mathbb{R}$ can be generated many ways
5. **Metrization:** Not all topologies come from metrics
6. **Universal properties:** Initial and final topologies characterized by continuous functions

Understanding generation methods provides flexibility in constructing and analyzing topological spaces. Different methods highlight different aspects of the topology's structure.
