# Box Topology

## Introduction

When forming the product of infinitely many topological spaces, there are two natural candidates for a topology: the **product topology** and the **box topology**. While the product topology is standard (and has better properties), the box topology is a natural alternative that is worth understanding, particularly to see why it's not used.

## Definition

**Definition 5.1 (Box Topology):** Let $\{X_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in I}$ be a family of topological spaces. The **box topology** on $\prod_{\alpha \in I} X_\alpha$ is the topology generated by the basis:
$$\mathcal{B}_{\text{box}} = \left\{\prod_{\alpha \in I} U_\alpha : U_\alpha \in \mathcal{T}_{X_\alpha} \text{ for all } \alpha \in I\right\}$$

In other words, basis elements are arbitrary products of open sets from each factor - with no restriction on how many coordinates are restricted.

**Comparison with Product Topology:**
- **Product topology basis:** $\prod_\alpha U_\alpha$ where $U_\alpha = X_\alpha$ for all but finitely many $\alpha$
- **Box topology basis:** $\prod_\alpha U_\alpha$ with no restriction

For finite products, the box topology and product topology coincide.

## Finite Products

**Theorem 5.1:** For finite products $X_1 \times \cdots \times X_n$, the box topology equals the product topology.

**Proof:** Every basis element in the product topology has the form $U_1 \times \cdots \times U_n$ where each $U_i$ is open in $X_i$. This is also a basis element for the box topology.

Conversely, every basis element in the box topology has the same form (since there are only finitely many factors, the restriction "all but finitely many equal the whole space" is vacuous). $\square$

**Conclusion:** The distinction between box and product topologies only matters for infinite products.

## Examples

**Example 5.1 (Countable Product of $\mathbb{R}$):**

Consider $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N} = \prod_{n=1}^\infty \mathbb{R}$.

**Product topology basis element:**
$$U = (a_1, b_1) \times (a_2, b_2) \times \cdots \times (a_n, b_n) \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \times \cdots$$
(only finitely many coordinates restricted)

**Box topology basis element:**
$$V = (a_1, b_1) \times (a_2, b_2) \times (a_3, b_3) \times \cdots$$
(infinitely many coordinates can be restricted)

For instance, in the box topology:
$$\prod_{n=1}^\infty (-1/n, 1/n) = \{(x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots) : |x_n| < 1/n \text{ for all } n\}$$
is a basis element (hence open). This set is NOT open in the product topology.

**Example 5.2:** In $\mathbb{R}^\omega = \prod_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{R}$ (countably infinite product):

The set:
$$U = \{(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} : -1 < x_n < 1 \text{ for all } n\}$$

is open in the box topology (it equals $\prod_{n=1}^\infty (-1, 1)$) but NOT open in the product topology.

To see it's not open in the product topology, consider the origin $\mathbf{0} = (0, 0, 0, \ldots)$. Any product topology basis element containing $\mathbf{0}$ has the form:
$$B = U_1 \times \cdots \times U_k \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \times \cdots$$

where each $U_i$ is an open interval containing $0$. Choose $M > k$. Then $(0, 0, \ldots, 0, 100, 0, 0, \ldots)$ (with $100$ in position $M$) is in $B$ but not in $U$. So no basis element around $\mathbf{0}$ is contained in $U$.

## Box Topology is Finer

**Theorem 5.2:** For any infinite product $\prod_{\alpha \in I} X_\alpha$, the box topology is finer than (or equal to) the product topology.

**Proof:** Every basis element in the product topology is a product $\prod_\alpha U_\alpha$ where $U_\alpha = X_\alpha$ for all but finitely many $\alpha$. This is also a product of open sets, hence a basis element in the box topology.

Therefore every product topology open set is also box topology open, so $\mathcal{T}_{\text{product}} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{\text{box}}$. $\square$

For infinite products, the inequality is strict (as Example 5.2 shows).

## Problems with Box Topology

While the box topology seems natural, it has several undesirable properties for infinite products:

### Problem 1: Tychonoff's Theorem Fails

**Theorem 5.3:** In the box topology, the product of infinitely many compact spaces need not be compact.

**Example 5.3 (Counterexample):** Consider $\prod_{n=1}^\infty [0, 1]$ with the box topology.

The cover:
$$\mathcal{U} = \left\{\prod_{n=1}^\infty [0, 1 - 1/n) : k \in \mathbb{N}\right\}$$

Actually, let me be more careful. Consider:
$$\mathcal{U} = \left\{\prod_{n=1}^\infty U_n^{(k)} : k \in \mathbb{N}\right\}$$

where $U_n^{(k)} = [0, 1)$ if $n \leq k$ and $U_n^{(k)} = [0, 1]$ if $n > k$.

Each set in $\mathcal{U}$ is open in the box topology (product of open sets in the subspace topology on $[0, 1]$). But:
$$\prod_{n=1}^\infty [0, 1] \neq \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty \prod_{n=1}^\infty U_n^{(k)}$$

Actually, this is getting complicated. Let me use a simpler example:

For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, let $U_n = [0, 1)$. Then $\prod_{n=1}^\infty U_n$ is open in the box topology (it's a basis element). But the point $(1, 1, 1, \ldots)$ is not in this set, and covering the whole product requires dealing with all possible combinations of including/excluding $1$ in each coordinate - which doesn't have a finite subcover.

The key point: **Tychonoff's theorem**, which states that products of compact spaces are compact, holds for the product topology but FAILS for the box topology on infinite products.

### Problem 2: Projections Not Always Continuous

**Theorem 5.4:** For the box topology on infinite products, the projection maps may not be continuous.

**Proof (Sketch):** Actually, projections ARE continuous for the box topology. The preimage of an open set $U_\alpha \subseteq X_\alpha$ under $\pi_\alpha$ is:
$$\pi_\alpha^{-1}(U_\alpha) = \prod_{\beta \neq \alpha} X_\beta \times U_\alpha$$

This is open in the box topology. So this is not the issue.

The real problem is different - let me correct this.

### Problem 2 (Corrected): Universal Property Fails

**Theorem 5.4 (Corrected):** The box topology does not satisfy the universal property of products for infinite products.

There exist continuous functions $f_\alpha: Z \to X_\alpha$ such that the induced function $f: Z \to \prod_\alpha X_\alpha$ given by $f(z) = (f_\alpha(z))_\alpha$ is NOT continuous in the box topology.

**Example 5.4:** Let $Z = \mathbb{R}$ and for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, let $f_n: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be the identity map $f_n(x) = x$.

Each $f_n$ is continuous. The induced map $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$ is:
$$f(x) = (x, x, x, x, \ldots)$$

(the diagonal embedding).

In the box topology, the set $U = \prod_{n=1}^\infty (-1/n, 1/n)$ is open. But:
$$f^{-1}(U) = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : |x| < 1/n \text{ for all } n\} = \{0\}$$

Since $\{0\}$ is not open in $\mathbb{R}$, the map $f$ is not continuous in the box topology.

This shows the box topology violates the expected universal property: continuous functions to each factor should induce a continuous function to the product.

### Problem 3: Not Categorical Product

The box topology does not give the categorical product in the category of topological spaces. The product topology does.

### Problem 4: Too Many Open Sets

The box topology has "too many" open sets, making it harder to prove functions are continuous and harder to prove compactness.

## When is Box Topology Used?

Despite its problems, the box topology has some uses:

1. **Finite products:** Where it equals the product topology
2. **Counterexamples:** It provides interesting counterexamples in topology
3. **Specialized contexts:** Some areas of analysis use box-like topologies

**Example 5.5:** In functional analysis, the topology of pointwise convergence on function spaces is related to a product topology, but the topology of uniform convergence is more like a box topology in certain contexts.

## Comparison Summary

| Property | Product Topology | Box Topology |
|----------|------------------|--------------|
| **Finite products** | Same | Same |
| **Infinite products** | Coarser | Finer |
| **Tychonoff's theorem** | Holds | Fails |
| **Universal property** | Satisfied | Fails |
| **Projections continuous** | Yes | Yes |
| **Diagonal continuous** | Yes | No (generally) |
| **Categorical product** | Yes | No |

## Why Product Topology is Standard

The product topology is the standard choice because:

1. **Tychonoff's theorem:** Preserves compactness
2. **Universal property:** Characterized by continuous functions
3. **Categorical:** Is the categorical product
4. **Natural:** Makes expected maps continuous

The restriction "all but finitely many coordinates unrestricted" seems artificial at first, but it's precisely what's needed for good topological properties.

## Visualizing the Difference

For $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$:

**Product topology:** "Tube topology" - neighborhoods are "fat" in finitely many coordinates, "infinite" in the rest

**Box topology:** "Box topology" - neighborhoods can be "thin" in all coordinates simultaneously

The product topology allows sequences to "escape to infinity" in infinitely many coordinates, while the box topology keeps them bounded in all coordinates if they start in a box.

## Further Study

For more on infinite products and their topologies, see:
- Tychonoff's theorem (in the compactness topic)
- Weak topologies in functional analysis
- Categorical products in category theory

## Summary

Key points:

1. **Box topology basis:** Arbitrary products $\prod_\alpha U_\alpha$ of open sets (no restriction)
2. **Product topology basis:** Only finitely many $U_\alpha \neq X_\alpha$
3. **Finite products:** Box = Product
4. **Infinite products:** Box strictly finer than Product
5. **Problems:** Tychonoff fails, universal property fails
6. **Standard choice:** Product topology is standard for good reasons

The box topology is an instructive example of how a "natural" construction can fail to have desired properties. The product topology, with its seemingly artificial restriction, is the correct choice for general topology.
