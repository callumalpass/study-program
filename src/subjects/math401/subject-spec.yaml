# ==============================================================================
# ASSESSMENT PHILOSOPHY
# ==============================================================================

assessment:
  philosophy: >
    Complex analysis requires both computational fluency and proof construction.
    Students must be able to compute integrals and residues efficiently while
    also understanding why theorems hold. Assessments balance calculation with
    conceptual understanding and occasional proof construction.

  measures:
    - Ability to compute contour integrals using various methods
    - Correct application of Cauchy's theorem and residue theorem
    - Proper classification of singularities
    - Construction of valid proofs for standard results
    - Problem-solving with conformal mappings

  anti_patterns:
    - Pure memorization of theorem statements without understanding
    - Asking students to prove theorems verbatim from text
    - Computational problems with no conceptual component
    - Problems requiring obscure tricks rather than systematic methods

    Exercises develop both computational skills (contour integrals, residue
    calculations, series expansions) and proof abilities. Written exercises
    allow for partial credit and multiple valid approaches.

# ==============================================================================
# PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

projects:
  required: false
  count: 0
  rationale: >
    Pure math courses traditionally assess via problem sets and exams rather than
    projects. The extensive exercise set provides sufficient practice and depth.

# ==============================================================================
# SUBJECT-SPECIFIC RED FLAGS
# ==============================================================================

red_flags:
  - Exercise requires remembering specific contour choices that aren't natural
  - Asking for proof of theorem exactly as in content
  - Integral evaluation requiring non-standard tricks
  - Conformal mapping problem with no clear geometric intuition
  - Quiz question testable only by memorization

# ==============================================================================
# NOTES
# ==============================================================================

notes: >
  Complex analysis is a beautiful subject where powerful theorems lead to
  elegant computational techniques. Content should emphasize both the aesthetic
  appeal of the theory and its practical applications. The residue theorem's
  ability to evaluate real integrals should be a highlight. Conformal mappings
  connect to physics applications that motivate the abstract theory.
