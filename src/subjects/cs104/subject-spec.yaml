# This spec guides content creation for a foundational data structures course.

# ==============================================================================
# SUBJECT IDENTITY
# ==============================================================================

id: cs104
title: Data Structures
category: cs

role:
  level: introductory
  transformation: >
    From "I can write programs" to "I can choose the right data structure for
    any problem and understand the performance tradeoffs." Students learn to
    think algorithmically about how data is organized and accessed.

# ==============================================================================
# PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH
# ==============================================================================

pedagogy:
  knowledge_type: mixed

  mastery_indicators:
    - Chooses appropriate data structure for a given problem
    - Implements fundamental data structures from scratch
    - Analyzes time and space complexity of operations
    - Traces through algorithms step by step
    - Recognizes when to use arrays vs linked structures

  common_struggles:

# ==============================================================================
# CONTENT STANDARDS
# ==============================================================================

content:
  subtopic_requirements:
    - Include complexity analysis for every operation
    - Show step-by-step visualizations for key algorithms
    - Provide Python implementations that are runnable
    - Compare alternatives (when to use which data structure)
    - Include common mistakes and how to avoid them

  conventions:
    - Python 3.10+ syntax
    - Big-O notation for complexity analysis
    - Consistent variable naming (node, left, right for trees)
    - Diagrams using ASCII art or described clearly in text

# ==============================================================================
# ASSESSMENT PHILOSOPHY
# ==============================================================================

assessment:
  philosophy: >
    Data structures mastery requires both conceptual understanding and
    implementation skills. Students should be able to trace through algorithms
    on paper, analyze complexity, and write correct implementations. Exercises
    progress from tracing to implementation to design.

  measures:
    - Correct implementation of data structure operations
    - Accurate complexity analysis
    - Algorithm tracing and debugging skills
    - Design decisions (choosing the right data structure)

  anti_patterns:
    - Memorizing specific implementations without understanding
    - Questions that only test syntax rather than concepts
    - Exercises with only one valid implementation approach
    - Problems solvable without understanding the data structure

# ==============================================================================
# GRADING THRESHOLDS
# ==============================================================================

grading:
  passing_score: 70

  thresholds:
    exercises: 70
    quizzes: 65
    exams: 65

  rationale: >
    Standard passing threshold. Data structures requires hands-on practice,
    so exercise threshold matches overall. Quiz and exam thresholds slightly
    lower since multiple-choice can be tricky even with conceptual understanding.

# ==============================================================================
# EXERCISE SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exercises:
  rationale: >
    Mix of implementation and analysis exercises. Early exercises focus on
    implementing individual operations, later exercises combine concepts.
    Automated tests provide immediate feedback on correctness.

  types:
    coding_with_tests: "90%"
    coding_ai_evaluated: "5%"
    written: "5%"
    justification: >
      Most exercises are coding with automated tests for immediate feedback.
      Some AI-evaluated for open-ended design questions. A few written for
      complexity analysis justifications.

  per_topic:
    minimum: 14
    target: 16
    maximum: 18
    justification: >
      Full base standard count. Data structures benefits from volume of
      practice with different operations and edge cases.

  difficulty_distribution:
    1: 3
    2: 3
    3: 4
    4: 3
    5: 3
    justification: >
      Standard distribution. Difficulty 1-2 for basic operations, 3 for
      combining concepts, 4-5 for optimization and complex implementations.

# ==============================================================================
# QUIZ SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

quizzes:
  rationale: >
    Quizzes test conceptual understanding and ability to trace through
    algorithms. They complement coding exercises by testing mental models.

  per_topic:
    count: 3
    questions_each: 5
    justification: >
      Standard base count. Three quizzes per topic: fundamentals, application,
      mastery. Mix of conceptual and code tracing questions.

  question_types:
    multiple_choice: "40%"
    true_false: "15%"
    fill_blank: "15%"
    code_output: "30%"
    coding: "0%"
    written: "0%"
    justification: >
      Heavy on code_output to test algorithm tracing ability. Multiple choice
      for conceptual understanding and complexity analysis.

# ==============================================================================
# EXAM SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exams:
  rationale: >
    Exams test comprehensive understanding without IDE assistance. Mix of
    tracing, analysis, and short implementation problems.

  midterm:
    questions:
      minimum: 24
      target: 26
      maximum: 30
    duration_minutes: 75
    format: >
      8-10 code tracing, 8-10 multiple choice on concepts and complexity,
      6-8 short implementation problems.
    coverage: "Topics 1-4: Arrays, linked lists, stacks/queues, trees"

  final:
    questions:
      minimum: 38
      target: 42
      maximum: 48
    duration_minutes: 120
    format: >
      12-15 code tracing, 12-15 multiple choice, 10-12 implementation.
      Emphasis on graphs, sorting, and heaps. At least one comprehensive
      problem integrating multiple data structures.
    coverage: "Comprehensive: all 7 topics"
    cumulative: true

# ==============================================================================
# PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

projects:
  required: true
  count: 2
  rationale: >
    Projects give students experience implementing larger data structures and
    seeing how they're used in realistic applications. Two projects: one
    focused on a single data structure implementation, one on applying multiple
    data structures to solve a problem.

  goals:
    - Implement a complete data structure with all operations
    - Apply data structures to solve a realistic problem
    - Handle edge cases and write thorough tests
    - Analyze and document time/space complexity

  estimated_hours: "10-15"

# ==============================================================================
# SUBJECT-SPECIFIC RED FLAGS
# ==============================================================================

red_flags:
  - Exercise expects specific implementation when multiple valid approaches exist
  - Complexity analysis question with ambiguous "best case" vs "worst case"
  - Tree problem uses 1-indexed arrays when course uses 0-indexed
  - Graph problem assumes directed when example shows undirected (or vice versa)
  - Hash table exercise tests specific hash function rather than concept

# ==============================================================================
# NOTES
# ==============================================================================

notes: >
  Data Structures bridges the gap between basic programming and algorithm
  analysis. Students should leave understanding not just HOW data structures
  work but WHEN to use each one. Content should emphasize tradeoffs and
  decision-making, not just implementation details.
