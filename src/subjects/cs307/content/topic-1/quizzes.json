          "Integrity",
          "Availability",
          "Authentication"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "Integrity",
        "explanation": "Integrity ensures that data remains accurate and unaltered by unauthorized parties. Confidentiality protects against unauthorized access, while Availability ensures systems remain accessible."

        "type": "true_false",
        "prompt": "Defense in depth means relying on a single, strong security control to protect your system.",
        "correctAnswer": "false",
        "explanation": "Defense in depth is the opposite - it involves layering multiple security controls so that if one fails, others are still in place to protect the system."

          "All permissions should be granted temporarily"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "Users should have only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their job",
        "explanation": "The principle of least privilege states that users, programs, and processes should have only the minimum privileges necessary to complete their tasks, reducing the attack surface."

        "correctAnswer": "true",
        "explanation": "Availability ensures that systems, applications, and data are accessible to authorized users when required. DDoS attacks and system failures are common threats to availability."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": "Fail-secure (fail-closed)",
        "explanation": "Fail-secure (or fail-closed) means that when a system encounters an error or failure, it should default to a secure state that denies access rather than allowing unrestricted access."

          "Using complex passwords"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "Hiding implementation details as the sole security measure",
        "explanation": "Security through obscurity relies on keeping the implementation secret. This is generally discouraged as a primary security measure because once the secret is discovered, the system is compromised. It may be used as an additional layer but never as the only defense."

        "correctAnswer": "true",
        "explanation": "Separation of duties divides critical functions among multiple people to prevent fraud and errors. For example, the person who approves payments should not be the same person who processes them."

          "Mediation should only occur during login"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "All access attempts must be checked every time",
        "explanation": "Complete mediation requires that every access to every resource is checked against the access control mechanism. This prevents attackers from exploiting cached permissions or bypassing checks after initial authentication."

        "correctAnswer": "The sum of all points where an attacker can try to enter or extract data",
        "explanation": "The attack surface encompasses all the different points where an unauthorized user could potentially enter data or extract data from a system. Reducing the attack surface is a key security principle."

        "correctAnswer": "true",

        ],
        "correctAnswer": "To identify, prioritize, and mitigate potential security threats early in development",
        "explanation": "Threat modeling is a proactive approach to identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle, allowing teams to prioritize and implement appropriate countermeasures before deployment."

        "correctAnswer": "Economy of mechanism",
        "explanation": "Economy of mechanism (also called simplicity) advocates for keeping security designs as simple as possible. Simple mechanisms are easier to verify, test, and are less likely to contain vulnerabilities than complex ones."

        "correctAnswer": "false",
        "explanation": "The principle of open design (Kerckhoffs's principle) states that the security of a system should not depend on the secrecy of its design. Instead, security should rely on the secrecy of keys or credentials, allowing the design to be publicly scrutinized."

        "options": [
          "It eliminates the need for security updates",
          "It provides multiple layers of protection so compromise of one layer doesn't compromise the entire system",
          "It makes systems immune to all attacks",
          "It reduces the cost of security implementation"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "It provides multiple layers of protection so compromise of one layer doesn't compromise the entire system",
        "explanation": "Defense in depth uses multiple, overlapping security controls. If one layer is compromised, additional layers continue to provide protection, making it significantly harder for attackers to breach the entire system."
