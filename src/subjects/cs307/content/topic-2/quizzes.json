      {
        "id": "cs307-q16",
        "type": "multiple_choice",
        "prompt": "Which type of encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption?",
        "options": [
          "Asymmetric encryption",
          "Public key encryption",
          "Symmetric encryption",
          "Hashing"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "Symmetric encryption",
        "explanation": "Symmetric encryption uses the same secret key for both encryption and decryption. Examples include AES, DES, and ChaCha20. It is faster than asymmetric encryption but requires secure key distribution."

        "type": "true_false",
        "prompt": "Hashing is a reversible process that allows you to decrypt data back to its original form.",
        "correctAnswer": false,
        "explanation": "Hashing is a one-way function that produces a fixed-size output from any input. It is designed to be irreversible - you cannot recover the original data from a hash. This makes it ideal for password storage and data integrity verification."

          "The sender's private key",
          "The sender's public key",
          "The recipient's private key",
          "The recipient's public key"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "The recipient's public key",
        "explanation": "To send a confidential message, you encrypt with the recipient's public key. Only the recipient can decrypt it with their corresponding private key. This ensures confidentiality even if the public key is widely known."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": "To verify the authenticity and integrity of a message",
        "explanation": "Digital signatures provide authentication (proving who sent the message) and integrity (proving the message wasn't altered). The sender signs with their private key, and anyone can verify with the sender's public key."

        "prompt": "AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is an example of symmetric encryption.",
        "correctAnswer": true,
        "explanation": "AES is a widely-used symmetric encryption algorithm that uses the same key for encryption and decryption. It supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits and is considered very secure when properly implemented."

        "explanation": "MD5 (Message Digest 5) is cryptographically broken and unsuitable for security applications. Collision attacks have been demonstrated, making it possible to create two different inputs that produce the same hash. Use SHA-256 or SHA-3 instead."

        "correctAnswer": false,
        "explanation": "While the public key is mathematically related to the private key, it is computationally infeasible to derive the private key from the public key. This one-way property is based on hard mathematical problems like factoring large numbers or discrete logarithms."

        "correctAnswer": "Cracking hashed passwords using precomputed hash values",
        "explanation": "A rainbow table is a precomputed table of hash values for common passwords. Attackers use these to quickly reverse hashes and discover passwords. Salting passwords before hashing defeats rainbow table attacks."

          "To compress the password"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "To ensure identical passwords produce different hashes",
        "explanation": "A salt is random data added to passwords before hashing. This ensures that even identical passwords produce different hashes, preventing rainbow table attacks and making it impossible to identify users with the same password."

        "correctAnswer": true,
        "explanation": "RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is an asymmetric encryption algorithm whose security relies on the computational difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. This makes it infeasible to derive the private key from the public key."

      {
        "id": "cs307-q26",
        "type": "multiple_choice",
        "prompt": "What is the main advantage of symmetric encryption over asymmetric encryption?",

          "No need for key management",
          "Provides digital signatures"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "Significantly faster performance",
        "explanation": "Symmetric encryption is much faster than asymmetric encryption, making it suitable for encrypting large amounts of data. However, it requires secure key distribution, which is why hybrid approaches often use asymmetric encryption to exchange symmetric keys."

        "prompt": "A cryptographic nonce should be reused across multiple encryption operations to maintain consistency.",
        "correctAnswer": false,
        "explanation": "A nonce (number used once) must never be reused with the same key in most encryption modes. Reusing a nonce can completely compromise security, potentially allowing attackers to decrypt messages or forge authenticated data."

          "TLS handshake"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)",
        "explanation": "HMAC uses a cryptographic hash function and a secret key to verify both data integrity and authenticity. However, it does not encrypt the data, so it provides no confidentiality. The message remains readable but tampering can be detected."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": "To issue and verify digital certificates that bind public keys to identities",
        "explanation": "A Certificate Authority is a trusted entity that issues digital certificates, which bind public keys to specific identities (like domain names or organizations). This allows users to trust that a public key actually belongs to who it claims to belong to."

        "correctAnswer": true,
        "explanation": "End-to-end encryption (E2EE) encrypts data on the sender's device and only decrypts it on the recipient's device. The service provider transmitting the data cannot access the content, only the encrypted form, ensuring maximum privacy."
