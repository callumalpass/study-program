id: cs307
title: Security Fundamentals
category: cs

role:
  level: intermediate
  transformation: >
    From "I write code that works" to "I write code that is secure by design,
    understand common attack vectors, and can implement defense-in-depth
    strategies." Students should finish able to identify vulnerabilities,
    implement secure coding practices, and conduct basic security assessments.

# ==============================================================================

    - Compliance frameworks (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC 2) - mentioned but not deep dive

# ==============================================================================
# PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH
# ==============================================================================

pedagogy:
  knowledge_type: applied

  mastery_indicators:
    - Identifies OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in code samples
    - Implements secure authentication with proper password hashing
    - Writes input validation that prevents injection attacks
    - Configures TLS/SSL correctly for web applications
    - Conducts basic security testing using industry tools
    - Explains security trade-offs in design decisions
    - Follows responsible disclosure principles

  common_struggles:
    - Thinking "security through obscurity" is sufficient protection
    - Implementing custom cryptography instead of using established libraries
    - Validating input on the client side only
    - Confusing encoding with encryption
    - Underestimating the importance of error handling in security
    - Not understanding the difference between authentication and authorization
    - Viewing security as a checkbox rather than continuous process

# ==============================================================================
# CONTENT STANDARDS
# ==============================================================================

content:
  subtopic_requirements:
    - Every vulnerability type must include both vulnerable and secure code examples
    - Show attack scenarios before explaining defenses (understand the threat first)
    - Include real-world breach examples where appropriate (anonymized if needed)
    - Emphasize ethical considerations and responsible disclosure throughout
    - Provide defense-in-depth strategies, not single-point solutions
    - All code examples must use established security libraries (not homebrew crypto)

  conventions:
    - Python 3.10+ for code examples (most accessible for security concepts)
    - Use cryptography, bcrypt, and requests libraries for secure implementations
    - Reference OWASP, NIST, and CWE standards where applicable
    - Include CVE references for discussed vulnerabilities
    - Mermaid diagrams for protocol flows and attack sequences

# ==============================================================================
# ASSESSMENT PHILOSOPHY
# ==============================================================================

assessment:
  philosophy: >
    Security knowledge must be practical and applicable. Students learn best by
    implementing secure code and identifying vulnerabilities in insecure code.
    Assessments should test both recognition of security issues and ability to
    implement countermeasures. Ethical considerations are as important as
    technical skills.

  measures:
    - Ability to identify vulnerabilities in code samples
    - Correct implementation of security controls (authentication, validation, encryption)
    - Understanding of attack vectors and defense strategies
    - Security design decision-making and trade-off analysis
    - Proper use of security tools and libraries

  anti_patterns:
    - Memorizing specific CVE details without understanding underlying vulnerability class
    - Testing exploit development rather than defensive techniques
    - Asking about obscure cryptographic internals not relevant to developers
    - Questions that encourage security theater over real protection
    - Assessment scenarios without ethical context

# ==============================================================================
# GRADING THRESHOLDS
# ==============================================================================

grading:
  passing_score: 70

  thresholds:
    exercises: 70
    quizzes: 70
    exams: 65

  rationale: >
    Security requires high competency - a 70% pass rate ensures students have
    solid foundational knowledge. Exam threshold is slightly lower because
    time-pressured security analysis can be challenging even for those who
    understand the concepts.

# ==============================================================================
# EXERCISE SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exercises:
  rationale: >
    Security is learned by doing. Students must implement secure code, fix
    vulnerable code, and analyze security scenarios. Exercises progress from
    implementing individual controls to building secure systems. Automated
    testing catches security mistakes immediately.

  types:
    coding_with_tests: "85%"
    coding_ai_evaluated: "10%"
    written: "5%"
    justification: >
      Most exercises are coding with tests for immediate feedback on security
      correctness. AI-evaluated coding for design exercises where multiple
      secure approaches are valid. Small percentage of written exercises for
      threat modeling and security analysis that can't be auto-tested.

  per_topic:
    minimum: 14
    target: 16
    maximum: 18
    justification: >
      Full base standard count. Security concepts benefit from extensive
      practice implementing countermeasures. Each exercise focuses on a
      specific vulnerability class or defense mechanism.

  difficulty_distribution:
    1: 3
    2: 3
    3: 4
    4: 3
    5: 3
    justification: >
      Standard distribution. Security concepts have clear beginner exercises
      (implement single control) but also need challenging exercises (design
      secure system, find subtle vulnerabilities). Difficulty 5 exercises
      involve complex attack scenarios.

# ==============================================================================
# QUIZ SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

quizzes:
  rationale: >
    Quizzes verify conceptual understanding of security principles, attack
    vectors, and defense strategies. They complement hands-on exercises by
    testing recognition and analysis skills.

  per_topic:
    count: 3
    questions_each: 5
    justification: >
      Standard base count. Three quizzes per topic allow progression from
      definitions (Quiz A) to scenario analysis (Quiz B) to complex trade-offs
      (Quiz C). 5 questions each keeps quizzes focused.

  question_types:
    multiple_choice: "50%"
    true_false: "15%"
    fill_blank: "10%"
    code_output: "25%"
    coding: "0%"
    written: "0%"
    justification: >
      Heavy on multiple choice for security scenario analysis where students
      choose the correct defense strategy. Code output questions test ability
      to identify what vulnerable code does. True/false for common
      misconceptions. Fill-blank for security terminology.

# ==============================================================================
# EXAM SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exams:
  rationale: >
    Exams test comprehensive security knowledge under time pressure. Students
    must identify vulnerabilities, choose appropriate defenses, and analyze
    security scenarios. Mix of recognition and short implementation problems.

  midterm:
    questions:
      minimum: 24
      target: 26
      maximum: 30
    duration_minutes: 75
    format: >
      10-12 vulnerability identification questions, 8-10 defense strategy
      questions, 4-6 short secure coding problems. Focus on security
      principles, cryptography basics, authentication, and common vulnerabilities.
    coverage: "Topics 1-4: Security Principles, Cryptography, Authentication, Vulnerabilities"

  final:
    questions:
      minimum: 45
      target: 52
      maximum: 55
    duration_minutes: 120
    format: >
      15-18 vulnerability analysis, 15-18 defense implementation choice,
      12-16 secure coding and configuration. Comprehensive coverage with
      emphasis on integration: secure system design combining multiple
      defense layers.
    coverage: "Comprehensive: all 7 topics with emphasis on secure coding and testing"
    cumulative: true

# ==============================================================================
# PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

projects:
  required: true
  count: 3
  rationale: >
    Security projects allow students to build complete secure systems,
    integrating multiple defense mechanisms. Projects emphasize defensive
    security and secure development practices rather than offensive techniques.

  goals:
    - Implement defense-in-depth with multiple security layers
    - Apply secure coding practices throughout a complete application
    - Use industry-standard security libraries correctly
    - Create security documentation and threat models
    - Practice ethical security testing on own code

  estimated_hours: "25-35"

# ==============================================================================
# SUBJECT-SPECIFIC RED FLAGS
# ==============================================================================

red_flags:
  - Exercise asks students to develop exploits or malware
  - Code example uses MD5 or SHA1 for password hashing (use bcrypt/argon2)
  - Solution implements custom encryption instead of using established libraries
  - Content suggests security through obscurity is effective
  - Exercise solution has SQL injection or other vulnerabilities
  - Missing ethical context around security testing or vulnerability disclosure
  - Quiz question rewards memorization of specific CVE numbers over understanding

# ==============================================================================
# NOTES
# ==============================================================================

notes: >
  This course teaches defensive security with ethical foundations. Students
  learn to identify and prevent vulnerabilities, not exploit them. All
  penetration testing content emphasizes authorized testing, responsible
  disclosure, and legal considerations. Code examples demonstrate both
  vulnerable patterns (to recognize) and secure implementations (to use).
  The goal is producing developers who write secure code by default.
