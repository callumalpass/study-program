        "correctAnswer": "Tiered compilation uses multiple compilation levels. Cold code runs interpreted or with quick, simple compilation. As methods get hotter (executed more), they are recompiled with more aggressive optimization. HotSpot uses: interpreter → C1 (client compiler, fast but less optimized) → C2 (server compiler, slower but highly optimized). This balances startup time with peak performance.",
        "explanation": "Tiered compilation optimizes both startup and peak performance."
