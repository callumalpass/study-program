# SUBJECT IDENTITY
# ==============================================================================

id: cs302
title: Computer Networks
category: cs

role:
  level: intermediate
  transformation: >
    From "networks are magic" to "I understand how data travels across the Internet,
    can analyze network protocols, and can build networked applications." Students
    should finish able to design and troubleshoot network systems.

# ==============================================================================
# PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH
# ==============================================================================

pedagogy:
  knowledge_type: mixed

  mastery_indicators:
    - Traces packet flow through the network stack for any given scenario
    - Calculates subnets, CIDR blocks, and routing table entries correctly
    - Implements client-server applications using TCP and UDP sockets
    - Analyzes protocol headers and identifies protocol behaviors
    - Debugs network connectivity issues using appropriate tools
    - Explains trade-offs between different protocols and architectures

  common_struggles:
    - Confusion between layers and which protocols operate where
    - Subnetting and CIDR calculations (binary arithmetic)
    - Understanding TCP state machines and connection management
    - Distinguishing between routing and forwarding
    - Socket programming concepts (blocking, concurrency, buffers)
    - Understanding why certain design choices were made (e.g., why TCP uses three-way handshake)

# ==============================================================================
# CONTENT STANDARDS
# ==============================================================================

content:
  subtopic_requirements:
    - Protocol headers should be shown in ASCII art or structured diagrams
    - Include practical examples with real IP addresses and port numbers
    - Show packet traces or Wireshark-style examples where relevant
    - Code examples in Python and/or C for socket programming topics
    - Connect theoretical concepts to real-world systems (e.g., "this is how Netflix streams video")

  conventions:
    - Python 3.x for socket programming examples
    - C for low-level networking examples where appropriate
    - Use standard port numbers and addresses in examples
    - Mermaid diagrams for network topologies and protocol flows
    - RFC references for protocol specifications

# ==============================================================================
# ASSESSMENT PHILOSOPHY
# ==============================================================================

assessment:
  philosophy: >
    Networking requires both conceptual understanding and practical skills.
    Assessments should test ability to trace protocol behavior, calculate
    addressing, and implement network code. Projects build real networked
    applications that demonstrate end-to-end understanding.

  measures:
    - Protocol analysis and packet tracing skills
    - Subnetting and addressing calculations
    - Socket programming implementation
    - Understanding of protocol design trade-offs
    - Troubleshooting and debugging network issues

  anti_patterns:
    - Memorization of port numbers or header field sizes without understanding
    - Multiple choice questions that can be answered by elimination
    - Socket programming exercises without proper error handling requirements
    - Questions that test RFC trivia rather than understanding

# ==============================================================================
# GRADING THRESHOLDS
# ==============================================================================

grading:
  passing_score: 70

  thresholds:
    exercises: 70
    quizzes: 65
    exams: 65

  rationale: >
    Standard thresholds for an intermediate course. Programming exercises
    require a higher bar because incorrect network code can be dangerous.
    Quiz and exam thresholds are slightly lower to account for the breadth
    of material covered.

# ==============================================================================
# EXERCISE SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exercises:
  rationale: >
    Networking requires hands-on practice with both calculations and code.
    Exercises range from subnetting math to socket programming. All coding
    exercises have automated tests because network code must handle edge cases.

  types:
    coding_with_tests: "85%"
    coding_ai_evaluated: "10%"
    written: "5%"
    justification: >
      Most exercises are coding with tests for immediate feedback. Some
      open-ended design questions (AI-evaluated) and a few written explanations
      for protocol analysis. Heavy emphasis on testable code.

  per_topic:
    minimum: 14
    target: 16
    maximum: 18
    justification: >
      Full base standard count. Networking topics have natural exercises:
      packet parsing, address calculations, socket programs. 16 per topic
      provides good coverage without overwhelming students.

  difficulty_distribution:
    1: 2
    2: 4
    3: 5
    4: 3
    5: 2
    justification: >
      Slight emphasis on medium difficulty. Level 1 exercises cover basic
      calculations and simple socket operations. Level 5 exercises involve
      complex protocol implementations or multi-threaded servers.

# ==============================================================================
# QUIZ SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

quizzes:
  rationale: >
    Quizzes test conceptual understanding and ability to trace protocol
    behavior. Code output questions are essential for verifying students
    can predict network behavior without running code.

  per_topic:
    count: 3
    questions_each: 5
    justification: >
      Standard quiz count. Three quizzes per topic allow progression from
      definitions to application to mastery. 15 questions per topic is
      sufficient for covering key concepts.

  question_types:
    multiple_choice: "40%"
    true_false: "15%"
    fill_blank: "15%"
    code_output: "30%"
    coding: "0%"
    written: "0%"
    justification: >
      Heavy on code_output to test protocol tracing skills (what does this
      code send? what will the server receive?). Multiple choice for
      conceptual understanding. Fill-blank for protocol fields and terms.

# ==============================================================================
# EXAM SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exams:
  rationale: >
    Exams test comprehensive understanding of networking concepts.
    Mix of conceptual questions, calculations (subnetting), and short
    coding problems. Students should be able to trace protocol behavior
    on paper.

  midterm:
    questions:
      minimum: 24
      target: 26
      maximum: 30
    duration_minutes: 75
    format: >
      8-10 multiple choice conceptual questions, 6-8 subnetting/addressing
      calculations, 5-6 protocol tracing questions, 4-6 short answer
      explaining protocol behavior or design choices.
    coverage: "Topics 1-4: Architecture, Physical/Data Link, Network Layer, Routing"

  final:
    questions:
      minimum: 38
      target: 42
      maximum: 46
    duration_minutes: 120
    format: >
      15-18 multiple choice, 8-10 calculations, 8-10 protocol tracing,
      8-12 short answer/coding. Cumulative with emphasis on transport
      layer, socket programming, and application protocols.
    coverage: "Comprehensive: all 7 topics"
    cumulative: true

# ==============================================================================
# PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

projects:
  required: true
  count: 2
  rationale: >
    Projects are essential for networking to integrate concepts into real
    applications. Students should build working networked systems that
    demonstrate understanding of protocols, socket programming, and
    application design. Two projects minimum; subject has 4 substantial
    options.

  goals:
    - Implement working client-server applications
    - Handle network errors and edge cases properly
    - Demonstrate understanding of protocols through implementation
    - Build something that could be extended for real use

  estimated_hours: "15-30"

# ==============================================================================
# SUBJECT-SPECIFIC RED FLAGS
# ==============================================================================

red_flags:
  - Socket code that ignores return values or error conditions
  - Subnetting exercises with ambiguous or invalid addresses
  - Protocol descriptions that contradict RFC specifications
  - Examples using deprecated or insecure protocols without noting it
  - Code that blocks indefinitely without timeout handling
  - Quiz questions that test memorization of obscure protocol details

# ==============================================================================
# NOTES
# ==============================================================================

notes: >
  Computer Networks is a core CS course that bridges theory and practice.
  Students often struggle early with the layered model but gain appreciation
  as they see how layers compose. Socket programming is where many students
  first encounter concurrent programming challenges. Content should emphasize
  the "why" behind protocol design, not just the "what." Real-world examples
  (how does Netflix work? how does a web browser connect?) make concepts
  concrete.
