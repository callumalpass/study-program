# ==============================================================================
# PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH
# ==============================================================================

pedagogy:
  knowledge_type: applied

  mastery_indicators:
    - Designs cloud architectures for given requirements
    - Containerizes applications with Docker best practices
    - Deploys and manages applications on Kubernetes
    - Implements serverless functions with proper event handling
    - Chooses appropriate storage solutions for different use cases
    - Applies cloud-native patterns (circuit breaker, service mesh)

# ==============================================================================
# CONTENT STANDARDS
# ==============================================================================

content:
  subtopic_requirements:
    - Include architecture diagrams for complex concepts
    - Show real CLI commands and YAML configurations
    - Provide cost comparisons where relevant
    - Include security considerations for each topic
    - Reference actual cloud provider services (AWS, Azure, GCP)

  conventions:
    - Use YAML for Kubernetes manifests
    - Use Dockerfile syntax for container builds
    - Python for Lambda/Cloud Functions examples
    - Bash for CLI scripts
    - Terraform/CloudFormation for IaC examples

# ==============================================================================
# ASSESSMENT PHILOSOPHY
# ==============================================================================

assessment:
  philosophy: >
    Cloud computing is hands-on by nature. Students learn by building and
    deploying. Exercises should use real tools (Docker, kubectl, AWS CLI)
    wherever possible. Assessment should test both conceptual understanding
    and practical ability to configure and troubleshoot.

  measures:
    - Ability to write correct Docker and Kubernetes configurations
    - Understanding of when to use different cloud services
    - Practical troubleshooting of deployment issues
    - Cost optimization awareness
    - Security best practices application

  anti_patterns:
    - Memorization of specific cloud provider console clicks
    - Questions about outdated pricing or service names
    - Exercises requiring paid cloud resources without alternatives
    - Testing trivia rather than architectural understanding

# ==============================================================================
# GRADING THRESHOLDS
# ==============================================================================

grading:
  passing_score: 70

  thresholds:
    exercises: 70
    quizzes: 65
    exams: 65

  rationale: >
    Standard passing thresholds. Cloud computing concepts build on each other,
    so strong foundations are important. Exercises may have some variation
    in approaches, so slightly lower quiz/exam thresholds allow for this.

# ==============================================================================
# EXERCISE SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exercises:
  rationale: >
    Exercises focus on practical skills: writing Dockerfiles, Kubernetes YAML,
    serverless functions, and cloud CLI commands. Each exercise should be
    completable using local tools (Docker, minikube) or free cloud tiers.

  types:
    coding_with_tests: "70%"
    coding_ai_evaluated: "30%"
    written: "0%"
    justification: >
      Most exercises are configuration files (Dockerfile, YAML) validated
      by structure/syntax tests. Some exercises involve design decisions
      evaluated by AI (architecture, cost optimization).

  per_topic:
    minimum: 14
    target: 16
    maximum: 18
    justification: >
      Full base standard count. Cloud computing covers many tools and patterns;
      students benefit from practice with each. Exercises cover Docker, K8s,
      serverless, storage, and cloud-native patterns.

  difficulty_distribution:
    1: 3
    2: 3
    3: 4
    4: 3
    5: 3
    justification: >
      Standard distribution. Cloud computing has a learning curve, but students
      at this level should handle medium-hard exercises. Difficulty 5 exercises
      involve multi-service architectures.

# ==============================================================================
# QUIZ SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

quizzes:
  rationale: >
    Quizzes test conceptual understanding of cloud models, architecture patterns,
    and best practices. Code output questions verify understanding of CLI
    behavior and configuration effects.

  per_topic:
    count: 3
    questions_each: 5
    justification: >
      Standard base count. Three quizzes per topic cover fundamentals,
      practical application, and advanced concepts.

  question_types:
    multiple_choice: "50%"
    true_false: "20%"
    fill_blank: "10%"
    code_output: "20%"
    coding: "0%"
    written: "0%"
    justification: >
      Heavy on multiple choice for architecture decisions. Code output
      for CLI commands and configuration effects. True/false for common
      misconceptions (security, pricing).

# ==============================================================================
# EXAM SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exams:
  rationale: >
    Exams test architectural thinking and practical knowledge. Mix of
    conceptual questions and configuration problems. Students should
    be able to design solutions without access to documentation.

  midterm:
    questions:
      minimum: 25
      target: 30
      maximum: 35
    duration_minutes: 75
    format: >
      Mix of multiple choice (cloud models, service selection), short
      configuration problems (write a Dockerfile, K8s manifest), and
      architecture questions.
    coverage: "Topics 1-4: Cloud fundamentals, virtualization, containers, Kubernetes"

  final:
    questions:
      minimum: 35
      target: 42
      maximum: 45
    duration_minutes: 120
    format: >
      Comprehensive exam covering all topics. Includes scenario-based
      questions (design a cloud architecture for X), debugging problems,
      and cost optimization questions.
    coverage: "All 7 topics with emphasis on serverless, storage, and cloud-native"
    cumulative: true

# ==============================================================================
# PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

projects:
  required: true
  count: 4
  rationale: >
    Projects are essential for cloud computing. Students build real
    deployable applications using containers, orchestration, serverless,
    and cloud-native patterns. Projects demonstrate practical skills.

  goals:
    - Deploy a containerized application to Kubernetes
    - Build a serverless API with database integration
    - Implement a cloud-native microservices architecture
    - Practice infrastructure as code

  estimated_hours: "10-15"

# ==============================================================================
# SUBJECT-SPECIFIC RED FLAGS
# ==============================================================================

red_flags:
  - Exercise requires paid cloud resources without free tier alternative
  - YAML/Dockerfile with syntax errors in starter code
  - Questions about deprecated cloud services
  - Exercises assuming specific cloud provider account setup
  - Missing security considerations (running as root, exposed secrets)
  - Outdated Kubernetes API versions

# ==============================================================================
# NOTES
# ==============================================================================

notes: >
  Cloud computing evolves rapidly. Content should focus on timeless concepts
  (virtualization, containerization, orchestration patterns) while providing
  current examples. Exercises should work with local tools (Docker Desktop,
  minikube, LocalStack) so students don't need cloud accounts. Warn about
  cost implications when discussing real cloud services.
