          "Servers are eliminated entirely",
          "Unlimited free computing resources",
          "You only pay for actual execution time, no idle costs",
          "Servers never crash"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "Serverless means you don't manage servers and only pay for actual execution time. The cloud provider handles infrastructure, scaling, and availability."

        "type": "true_false",
        "prompt": "Cold starts in serverless functions occur when a function hasn't been invoked recently.",
        "correctAnswer": true,
        "explanation": "Cold start is the latency when a function is invoked after being idle. The runtime environment must be initialized, causing higher latency than warm starts."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 3,
        "explanation": "Event-driven architecture is a software pattern where components communicate asynchronously through events. Producers emit events, consumers react to them."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "SNS (Simple Notification Service) and SQS (Simple Queue Service) are AWS messaging services. SNS is pub/sub, SQS is queuing. Both trigger Lambda functions."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "Dead Letter Queues (DLQ) capture failed events for later analysis or retry. Lambda can send failed events to SQS or SNS DLQs."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 3,
        "explanation": "Reduce cold starts by: increasing memory (faster CPU), keeping functions warm with scheduled pings, using provisioned concurrency, and minimizing dependencies."
