# Database Storage

## Overview

Cloud storage provides scalable, durable solutions for data persistence. This section covers Database Storage.

## Key Concepts

- Scalability: Automatic capacity adjustment
- Durability: Data protection and redundancy
- Performance: IOPS, throughput, latency
- Security: Encryption, access control
- Cost: Storage tiers and optimization

## Storage Classes/Tiers

- **Standard**: Frequent access
- **Infrequent Access**: Lower cost, retrieval fees
- **Archive**: Lowest cost, retrieval delay
- **Intelligent Tiering**: Automatic optimization

## Best Practices

1. Use appropriate storage class
2. Enable encryption at rest
3. Implement lifecycle policies
4. Set up backup and replication
5. Monitor costs and usage
6. Apply least privilege access

## Security

- Encryption: At rest and in transit
- Access Control: IAM, bucket policies
- Versioning: Protect against deletions
- Logging: Audit access and changes
- Compliance: HIPAA, PCI DSS, GDPR

## Performance Optimization

- Choose right storage type
- Enable caching (CloudFront)
- Use multipart uploads for large files
- Optimize I/O patterns
- Monitor performance metrics

## Cost Optimization

- Use lifecycle transitions
- Delete unnecessary data
- Enable compression
- Use reserved capacity
- Implement data retention policies

## Summary

Cloud storage offers scalable, durable solutions with multiple tiers, security features, and optimization opportunities for cost and performance.
