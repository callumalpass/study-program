        "prompt": "Which of the following is NOT one of the five essential characteristics of cloud computing according to NIST?",
        "options": [
          "On-demand self-service",
          "Broad network access",
          "Guaranteed uptime",
          "Rapid elasticity"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "The five essential characteristics are: on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service. Guaranteed uptime is an SLA consideration, not an essential characteristic."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) provides virtual machines where customers control the operating system. In PaaS, the provider manages the OS. In SaaS, the provider manages everything except data and access."
