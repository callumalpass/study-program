        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "Type 1 hypervisors (bare-metal) run directly on hardware. Type 2 hypervisors (hosted) run as applications on a conventional operating system."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Memory ballooning allows the hypervisor to reclaim unused memory from VMs by inflating a balloon driver in the guest OS, which then releases memory back to the hypervisor."
