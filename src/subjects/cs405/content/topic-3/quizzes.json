          "Containers are slower than VMs",
          "Containers share the host OS kernel, VMs have separate kernels",
          "VMs are more portable than containers",
          "Containers require more resources than VMs"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Containers share the host OS kernel and provide process-level isolation, making them lighter and faster. VMs have complete operating systems with separate kernels."

        "prompt": "Docker containers can run on any operating system without modification.",
        "correctAnswer": false,
        "explanation": "Docker containers must share the host OS type. Linux containers run on Linux hosts, Windows containers on Windows hosts. Though Docker Desktop uses a Linux VM to run Linux containers on Windows/Mac."

          "iptables"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Namespaces provide isolation (PID, network, mount, etc.). Cgroups limit resources. Together they form the foundation of container isolation."

        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "A Docker image is a read-only template containing the application and dependencies. A container is a running instance of an image."

        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "RUN, COPY, and ADD instructions create new layers. ENV, LABEL, EXPOSE, and other metadata instructions don't create layers."

        "explanation": "Multi-stage builds allow using build tools in early stages while copying only necessary artifacts to the final stage, significantly reducing image size."

          "none"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Bridge network is the default. Containers get private IPs and can communicate with each other via the bridge. Port mapping is required for external access."

        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Host networking mode removes network isolation, giving containers direct access to the host's network stack. No port mapping needed but less isolation."

        ],

          "Volumes only work on Linux"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
