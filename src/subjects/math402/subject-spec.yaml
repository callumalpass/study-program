# PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH
# ==============================================================================

pedagogy:
  knowledge_type: applied

    - Implements numerical algorithms correctly in Python
    - Analyzes convergence rates and error bounds for algorithms
    - Chooses appropriate methods based on problem characteristics
    - Identifies and avoids numerical instabilities
    - Validates numerical solutions through error analysis

  common_struggles:

    - Ignoring numerical stability in algorithm implementation
    - Choosing inappropriate step sizes or tolerances
    - Misunderstanding convergence rate notation (O(h) vs O(h^2))
    - Applying methods outside their convergence regions
    - Overlooking the impact of condition numbers on accuracy

# ==============================================================================
# CONTENT STANDARDS

content:
  subtopic_requirements:
    - Every algorithm should include a complete Python implementation
    - Error analysis with both theoretical bounds and practical examples
    - Convergence proofs or explanations for each iterative method
    - Worked examples showing step-by-step calculations
    - Comparison with alternative methods where applicable
    - Discussion of when to use and when to avoid each method

  conventions:
    - Python 3.10+ with NumPy for all implementations
    - LaTeX for mathematical expressions
    - Consistent notation for errors (ε for machine epsilon, h for step size)
    - Big-O notation for complexity and convergence analysis
    - IEEE 754 double precision as the default floating-point format

# ==============================================================================
# ASSESSMENT PHILOSOPHY
# ==============================================================================

assessment:
  philosophy: >
    Numerical methods combines mathematical theory with practical implementation.
    Assessments should test both: ability to analyze algorithms theoretically
    (convergence, stability, error bounds) and ability to implement and apply
    them correctly. Students should demonstrate understanding of when methods
    work and when they fail.

  measures:
    - Correct implementation of numerical algorithms
    - Error analysis and convergence rate determination
    - Selection of appropriate methods for given problems
    - Understanding of numerical stability concepts
    - Ability to diagnose and fix numerical issues

  anti_patterns:
    - Memorization of formulas without understanding derivation
    - Implementing algorithms without testing against known solutions
    - Ignoring error analysis in practical applications
    - Treating all problems as equally well-conditioned

# ==============================================================================
# GRADING THRESHOLDS
# ==============================================================================

grading:
  passing_score: 70

  thresholds:
    exercises: 70
    quizzes: 65
    exams: 65

  rationale: >
    Standard passing threshold as this is an applied course where implementation
    correctness is verifiable. Quizzes test conceptual understanding which can
    be nuanced, so slightly lower threshold there. Exams allow partial credit
    for correct approaches even with computational errors.

# ==============================================================================
# EXERCISE SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exercises:
  rationale: >
    Numerical methods is learned by doing. Each exercise should require
    implementing an algorithm, analyzing its behavior, or solving a computational
    problem. The mix of coding and written exercises reflects the dual nature
    of the subject: implementation skills and theoretical understanding.

  types:
    coding_with_tests: "60%"
    coding_ai_evaluated: "20%"
    written: "20%"
    justification: >
      Most exercises are coding with tests for immediate feedback on correctness.
      Some open-ended coding problems (algorithm design, optimization) need AI
      evaluation. Written exercises cover error analysis and theoretical questions
      that require mathematical derivation.

  per_topic:
    minimum: 14
    target: 16
    maximum: 18
    justification: >
      Full base standard. Each topic has substantial algorithmic content that
      requires practice. The mix of implementation and analysis exercises provides
      comprehensive coverage of each numerical method.

  difficulty_distribution:
    1: 2
    2: 4
    3: 5
    4: 3
    5: 2
    justification: >
      Slightly weighted toward middle difficulties. Basic implementation exercises
      at difficulty 1-2, standard applications at 3, complex analysis and edge
      cases at 4-5. Fewer difficulty-5 since numerical methods already has high
      conceptual overhead.

# ==============================================================================
# QUIZ SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

quizzes:
  rationale: >
    Quizzes test conceptual understanding of algorithms and error analysis
    without requiring full implementations. They verify students understand
    convergence properties, stability concepts, and can trace algorithm behavior.

  per_topic:
    count: 3
    questions_each: 5
    justification: >
      Standard base count. Three quizzes per topic allow progression from
      basic definitions to application to mastery of edge cases and error analysis.

  question_types:
    multiple_choice: "50%"
    true_false: "15%"
    fill_blank: "15%"
    code_output: "20%"
    coding: "0%"
    written: "0%"
    justification: >
      Heavy on multiple choice for testing conceptual understanding of convergence,
      stability, and method properties. Code output for tracing algorithm steps.
      Fill-blank for formulas and error expressions. No full coding in quizzes.

# ==============================================================================
# EXAM SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exams:
  rationale: >
    Exams test comprehensive understanding including algorithm derivation,
    error analysis, method selection, and short implementations. Time pressure
    tests fluency with fundamental techniques.

  midterm:
    questions:
      minimum: 24
      target: 26
      maximum: 30
    duration_minutes: 90
    format: >
      Mix of conceptual questions (convergence, stability), short derivations
      (error bounds, Taylor series), algorithm tracing, and brief coding problems.
      Emphasis on Topics 1-4: error analysis, root-finding, interpolation, integration.
    coverage: "Topics 1-4"

  final:
    questions:
      minimum: 38
      target: 42
      maximum: 48
    duration_minutes: 150
    format: >
      Comprehensive coverage of all topics with emphasis on linear algebra methods
      (Topics 5-6) and ODEs (Topic 7). Includes method comparison questions and
      multi-step problems requiring integration of concepts.
    coverage: "All 7 topics, comprehensive"
    cumulative: true

# ==============================================================================
# PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

projects:
  required: false
  count: 0
  rationale: >
    As a MATH subject, extensive exercises with implementations serve the role
    that projects would in a CS subject. The coding exercises provide substantial
    implementation practice. Full projects are not required.

# ==============================================================================
# SUBJECT-SPECIFIC RED FLAGS
# ==============================================================================

red_flags:
  - Code example that would produce numerically unstable results
  - Algorithm without discussion of convergence conditions
  - Missing error bounds or accuracy analysis
  - Implementation that ignores special cases (zero pivot, convergence failure)
  - Exercises requiring libraries not covered in the course (scipy.optimize, etc.)
  - Confusion between O(h) and O(h^2) convergence in explanations
  - Recommending methods for problems where they don't converge

# ==============================================================================
# NOTES
# ==============================================================================

notes: >
  Numerical Methods bridges pure mathematics and computer science. Content should
  emphasize both rigorous analysis (error bounds, convergence proofs) and practical
  implementation (Python code, numerical experiments). Students should finish able
  to implement fundamental numerical algorithms, analyze their accuracy, and choose
  appropriate methods for real-world computational problems. All code examples should
  be complete, runnable, and demonstrate good numerical practices.
