          "n+1"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "A polynomial of degree at most n is uniquely determined by n+1 points. The actual degree may be less than n if the data lies on a lower-degree curve."

        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Newton's form is incremental: adding a new point requires only computing one new divided difference and adding one term, whereas Lagrange requires recomputing all basis polynomials."
