# ==============================================================================
# PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH
# ==============================================================================

pedagogy:
  knowledge_type: mixed

  mastery_indicators:
    - Constructs truth tables and determines logical equivalences
    - Writes clear direct proofs and proofs by contradiction
    - Correctly uses set-builder notation and performs set operations
    - Identifies properties of relations (reflexive, symmetric, transitive)
    - Determines whether functions are injective, surjective, or bijective
    - Translates English statements to predicate logic and vice versa
    - Evaluates summations using standard formulas

  common_struggles:
    - Confusing implication direction (P → Q vs Q → P)
    - Misunderstanding that implication is false only when T → F
    - Set difference A - B confused with B - A (not symmetric)
    - Forgetting that functions require every input to have exactly one output
    - Negating quantified statements incorrectly (∀ vs ∃)
    - Mixing up relation properties (symmetric vs antisymmetric)
    - Off-by-one errors in summation bounds

# ==============================================================================
# CONTENT STANDARDS
# ==============================================================================

content:
  subtopic_requirements:
    - Clear definitions with immediate concrete examples
    - Visual representations where applicable (truth tables, Venn diagrams)
    - Connection to programming and CS applications throughout
    - Step-by-step worked examples for proof techniques
    - Common mistakes explicitly addressed with corrections

  conventions:
    - LaTeX for all mathematical expressions
    - Standard logic symbols (∧, ∨, ¬, →, ↔, ∀, ∃)
    - Set notation using braces {} and set-builder notation
    - Functions written as f: A → B with clear domain/codomain

# ==============================================================================
# ASSESSMENT PHILOSOPHY
# ==============================================================================

assessment:
  philosophy: >
    Discrete mathematics is foundational for CS. Assessment balances conceptual
    understanding (truth tables, set operations) with proof construction (the key
    transferable skill). Students should practice both mechanical procedures and
    logical argumentation. Volume of practice matters—discrete math fluency comes
    from working many problems.

  measures:
    - Correct construction and evaluation of truth tables
    - Ability to write clear, complete proofs
    - Accurate set manipulation and function analysis
    - Proper use of quantifiers and logical notation
    - Translation between formal and informal statements

  anti_patterns:
    - Asking students to reproduce specific proofs from lectures verbatim
    - Testing obscure edge cases rather than core understanding
    - Problems that only require pattern matching without reasoning
    - Ambiguous word problems where logical interpretation is unclear

# ==============================================================================
# GRADING THRESHOLDS
# ==============================================================================

grading:
  passing_score: 70

  thresholds:
    exercises: 70
    quizzes: 65
    exams: 65

  rationale: >
    Standard passing threshold for a foundational course. Students need solid
    discrete math skills for later CS courses. Quiz/exam thresholds slightly
    lower because proof problems can be challenging under time pressure.

# ==============================================================================
# EXERCISE SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exercises:
  rationale: >
    High volume of practice builds fluency with discrete structures. Drill
    exercises provide quick reinforcement of definitions. Core exercises develop
    proof-writing and problem-solving skills. All exercises are written/proof-based
    as this is a pure mathematics subject.

  types:
    coding_with_tests: "0%"
    coding_ai_evaluated: "0%"
    written: "100%"
    justification: >
      Pure mathematics subject. All exercises are proofs, truth table construction,
      set manipulation, or function analysis. AI evaluation compares student work
      to reference solutions for correctness and completeness.

  per_topic:
    minimum: 16
    target: 20
    maximum: 24
    justification: >
      Higher than base standard (20 vs 16) because introductory discrete math
      benefits from volume of practice. Includes 4 drill exercises for quick
      definition/procedure practice plus 16 core exercises of varying difficulty.
      More practice opportunities help students build fluency.

  difficulty_distribution:
    1: 4
    2: 5
    3: 6
    4: 3
    5: 2
    justification: >
      Skewed toward easier exercises for an introductory course. Difficulty 1
      exercises are drills (direct application of definitions). Majority at
      difficulty 2-3 (standard problems requiring modest proof or analysis).
      A few difficulty 4-5 exercises provide challenge for advanced students.

# ==============================================================================
# QUIZ SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

quizzes:
  rationale: >
    Quizzes check conceptual understanding and procedural fluency before students
    tackle full exercises. Mix of question types addresses different skills:
    recall, recognition, evaluation, and short construction.

  per_topic:
    count: 3
    questions_each: 5
    justification: >
      Standard base count. Three quizzes per topic (A: fundamentals, B: application,
      C: mastery) provide staged assessment. 15 questions per topic ensures
      comprehensive coverage of key concepts.

  question_types:
    multiple_choice: "45%"
    true_false: "25%"
    fill_blank: "20%"
    code_output: "0%"
    coding: "0%"
    written: "10%"
    justification: >
      Heavy on multiple choice and true/false for quick assessment of concepts.
      Fill-blank for notation and terminology. Limited written for short proofs
      or translations. No coding—this is pure mathematics.

# ==============================================================================
# EXAM SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exams:
  rationale: >
    Exams assess both conceptual understanding and proof construction skills.
    Mix of question types tests breadth (many short questions) and depth (written
    proof problems). Time pressure is moderate—students should have time to think.

  midterm:
    questions:
      minimum: 22
      target: 26
      maximum: 30
    duration_minutes: 75
    format: >
      ~10-12 multiple choice conceptual questions, ~5-6 true/false,
      ~4-5 fill-in-blank for notation/definitions, ~3-4 short written proofs
      or truth table constructions. Emphasis on Topics 1-4.
    coverage: "Topics 1-4: Propositional Logic, Proof Techniques, Sets, Relations"

  final:
    questions:
      minimum: 38
      target: 44
      maximum: 50
    duration_minutes: 120
    format: >
      Comprehensive coverage of all topics. ~16-18 multiple choice,
      ~8-10 true/false, ~6-8 fill-blank, ~8-10 written (proofs, truth tables,
      function analysis). Later topics (functions, predicate logic, sequences)
      weighted slightly heavier.
    coverage: "Comprehensive: all 7 topics"
    cumulative: true

# ==============================================================================
# PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

projects:
  required: false
  count: 0
  rationale: >
    Mathematics courses traditionally assess via problem sets and exams rather
    than projects. The exercises serve as distributed practice. No separate
    projects needed for a foundational discrete math course.

# ==============================================================================
# SUBJECT-SPECIFIC RED FLAGS
# ==============================================================================

red_flags:
  - Exercise requires proof technique not yet covered in the curriculum
  - Truth table problem has more than 3 variables (8 rows is reasonable maximum)
  - Set problem uses notation not introduced in content
  - Function problem conflates partial functions with total functions
  - Quantifier problem has ambiguous scope
  - Proof problem has unique "trick" solution not generalizable to other problems
  - Quiz question tests obscure theorem rather than fundamental concept

# ==============================================================================
# NOTES
# ==============================================================================

notes: >
  Discrete Mathematics I is the mathematical foundation for computer science.
  Content should consistently connect abstract concepts to CS applications:
  logic to circuit design and programming conditions, sets to databases and
  data types, relations to database schemas, functions to programming functions,
  sequences to algorithm analysis. Students should leave understanding why
  discrete math matters for their CS career, not just how to manipulate symbols.
