        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "Data replication maintains multiple copies of data across different nodes, improving availability (data accessible despite failures) and fault tolerance (surviving failures)."

        "correctAnswer": 3,
        "explanation": "A majority quorum (N/2 + 1) ensures that any two quorums overlap, guaranteeing that reads will see recent writes. This allows tolerating N/2 failures while maintaining consistency."
