          "Process continues with wrong behavior"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "In fail-stop failures, a process halts completely and other processes can reliably detect that it has failed, making it easier to handle than other failure types."

        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "BFT systems require at least 3f+1 nodes to tolerate f Byzantine failures, meaning they can tolerate less than one-third failures, which is more expensive than crash tolerance."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "The orphan problem occurs when a recovered process doesn't remember sending messages before failure, but other processes have received them and acted on them, causing inconsistencies."

        "correctAnswer": 3,
