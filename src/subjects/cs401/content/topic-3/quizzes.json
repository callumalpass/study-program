          "Getting all nodes to agree on a single value"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 3,
        "explanation": "Distributed consensus requires all non-faulty nodes to agree on a single value, with the agreement being final and irrevocable, despite failures and asynchrony."

        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Consensus requires agreement, validity, and termination, but not necessarily fast execution. Speed is a practical concern but not a correctness requirement."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 3,
        "explanation": "If the coordinator fails after participants prepare but before sending commit/abort decisions, participants are blocked indefinitely, unable to unilaterally decide the transaction outcome."

        "correctAnswer": 2,

        "correctAnswer": 3,
