        ],
        "correctAnswer": "Getting all nodes to agree on a single value",
        "explanation": "Distributed consensus requires all non-faulty nodes to agree on a single value, with the agreement being final and irrevocable, despite failures and asynchrony."

        "correctAnswer": "Fast execution",
        "explanation": "Consensus requires agreement, validity, and termination, but not necessarily fast execution. Speed is a practical concern but not a correctness requirement."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": "Coordinator failure blocks progress",
        "explanation": "If the coordinator fails after participants prepare but before sending commit/abort decisions, participants are blocked indefinitely, unable to unilaterally decide the transaction outcome."

        "correctAnswer": "A prepare-to-commit phase",
        "explanation": "3PC adds a prepare-to-commit phase between prepare and commit, allowing participants to timeout and make progress if the coordinator fails, though this requires synchrony assumptions."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": "Achieve consensus on a single value",
        "explanation": "Paxos is a consensus algorithm that allows a collection of nodes to agree on a single value even in the presence of failures, forming the basis for many distributed systems."

        "correctAnswer": "Raft is designed to be more understandable",
