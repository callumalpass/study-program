# ==============================================================================
# ASSESSMENT PHILOSOPHY
# ==============================================================================

assessment:
  philosophy: >
    ODEs bridge pure mathematics and applications. Assessment combines analytical
    solution skills with computational implementation. Students should demonstrate
    both hand-solving ability (for conceptual understanding) and programming skills
    (for practical application). Computational exercises provide immediate feedback
    on correctness.

  measures:
    - Correct application of solution techniques
    - Ability to set up equations from word problems
    - Numerical implementation accuracy
    - Qualitative analysis of solutions (stability, long-term behavior)
    - Interpretation of results in application contexts

  anti_patterns:
    - Asking only for final answers without showing method
    - Problems requiring only memorized formulas
    - Overly complex algebra that obscures concepts
    - Numerical exercises without analytical verification

# ==============================================================================
# GRADING THRESHOLDS
# ==============================================================================

grading:
  passing_score: 70

  thresholds:
    exercises: 70
    quizzes: 65
    exams: 65

  rationale: >
    Standard passing threshold for intermediate mathematics. Computational
    exercises allow immediate verification, so 70% is achievable. Quiz thresholds
    slightly lower to account for conceptual questions that may have multiple
    valid interpretations.

# ==============================================================================
# EXERCISE SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exercises:
  rationale: >
    Exercises combine analytical understanding with computational verification.
    Python implementations test both correctness and understanding of the
    solution structure. NumPy/SciPy provides real-world tools students will
    use in scientific computing careers.

  types:
    coding_with_tests: "100%"
    coding_ai_evaluated: "0%"
    written: "0%"
    justification: >
      All exercises are Python implementations with automated testing. This
      approach provides immediate feedback, verifies numerical correctness,
      and builds computational skills alongside analytical understanding.
      The solution code demonstrates the analytical solution.

  per_topic:
    minimum: 14
    target: 16
    maximum: 18
    justification: >
      Standard base count. ODEs require practice with variations of each
      method (different coefficient types, initial conditions, etc.).
      Computational exercises can be completed efficiently with feedback.

  difficulty_distribution:
    1: 3
    2: 3
    3: 4
    4: 3
    5: 3
    justification: >
      Standard distribution. Difficulty 1-2 for direct method application,
      difficulty 3-4 for combining techniques or handling special cases,
      difficulty 5 for modeling problems or challenging analytical work.

# ==============================================================================
# QUIZ SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

quizzes:
  rationale: >
    Quizzes test conceptual understanding and quick recall of methods without
    extensive computation. They catch students who can copy code but don't
    understand why it works.

  per_topic:
    count: 3
    questions_each: 5
    justification: >
      Standard base count. Three quizzes allow progression: Quiz A (definitions,
      classification), Quiz B (method identification, short solutions),
      Quiz C (edge cases, theoretical understanding).

  question_types:
    multiple_choice: "50%"
    true_false: "20%"
    fill_blank: "20%"
    code_output: "10%"
    coding: "0%"
    written: "0%"
    justification: >
      Heavy on multiple choice for method selection and conceptual questions.
      True/false for common misconceptions. Fill-blank for formulas and
      definitions. Some code output for tracing numerical methods.

# ==============================================================================
# EXAM SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exams:
  rationale: >
    Exams test understanding without computational aids. Mix of short
    problems (classify and solve) with longer multi-step problems.
    Students should spend 3-4 minutes on identification questions,
    8-10 minutes on standard solution problems.

  midterm:
    questions:
      minimum: 22
      target: 26
      maximum: 30
    duration_minutes: 75
    format: >
      8-10 classification/short-answer questions (2-3 min each),
      8-10 solution problems (5-7 min each), 4-6 application problems
      (7-10 min each). Focus on first-order methods and second-order
      constant coefficient equations.
    coverage: "Topics 1-4: First-order, second-order, higher-order, systems"

  final:
    questions:
      minimum: 38
      target: 42
      maximum: 50
    duration_minutes: 120
    format: >
      Comprehensive with emphasis on Topics 5-7 (Laplace transforms, series
      solutions, applications). Include at least one problem from each topic.
      Mix of short identification and full solution problems.
    coverage: "Comprehensive: all 7 topics"
    cumulative: true

# ==============================================================================
# PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

projects:
  required: false
  count: 0
  rationale: >
    Mathematics subjects traditionally assess via problem sets and exams.
    The computational exercises effectively serve as ongoing mini-projects
    building a toolkit for solving ODEs. No separate large projects needed.

# ==============================================================================
# SUBJECT-SPECIFIC RED FLAGS
# ==============================================================================

red_flags:
  - Solution uses SymPy when analytical method was required
  - Test case expects specific float precision not mentioned in problem
  - Exercise requires technique not yet covered in curriculum
  - Phase portrait exercise but equilibrium classification not taught
  - Numerical method exercise with insufficient stability discussion
  - Application problem with unrealistic parameter values

# ==============================================================================
# NOTES
# ==============================================================================

notes: >
  MATH302 takes a computational approach to ODEs, reflecting modern practice
  in applied mathematics and engineering. Students should be comfortable with
  both pencil-and-paper solutions (for understanding) and computer implementation
  (for practical application). The Python/NumPy exercises verify analytical work
  and build skills for scientific computing. Phase portraits and stability
  analysis prepare students for dynamical systems in upper-division courses.
