    - High school algebra (solving equations, basic manipulation)
    - Familiarity with coordinate geometry (points, lines, planes)
    - Basic understanding of functions and graphs
    - Some exposure to vectors (magnitude, direction) is helpful but not required

    - Inner product spaces and orthogonality (often a separate follow-up course)
    - Singular Value Decomposition in depth (graduate-level treatment)
    - Numerical stability and advanced computational methods (Numerical Methods course)
    - Infinite-dimensional vector spaces (functional analysis)

# ==============================================================================
# PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH
# ==============================================================================

pedagogy:
  knowledge_type: mixed

  mastery_indicators:
    - Performs Gaussian elimination correctly on 3×3 and larger systems
    - Determines whether a set of vectors is linearly independent
    - Computes determinants using cofactor expansion and row reduction
    - Finds eigenvalues and eigenvectors for 2×2 and 3×3 matrices
    - Determines whether a matrix is diagonalizable and computes the diagonalization
    - Interprets linear transformations geometrically (rotations, reflections, projections)
    - Applies matrix methods to solve real-world problems

  common_struggles:
    - Confusing row operations with column operations
    - Forgetting that matrix multiplication is not commutative
    - Mixing up row space, column space, and null space
    - Errors in determinant computation (sign errors in cofactors)
    - Difficulty with abstract vector space concepts beyond ℝⁿ
    - Confusing eigenvalues with diagonal entries
    - Not recognizing when a matrix is not diagonalizable

# ==============================================================================

# ==============================================================================
# ASSESSMENT PHILOSOPHY
# ==============================================================================

assessment:
  philosophy: >
    Linear algebra requires both computational fluency and conceptual understanding.
    Students must be able to perform matrix computations accurately AND understand
    what those computations mean geometrically. Assessments balance computation
    (can you do the algorithm?) with conceptual questions (what does this result mean?).

  measures:
    - Ability to perform matrix operations correctly
    - Understanding of vector space structure (span, independence, basis)
    - Computation of determinants, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors
    - Application of concepts to solve systems and analyze transformations
    - Geometric interpretation of algebraic results

  anti_patterns:
    - Asking for memorization of specific matrix entries
    - Trick questions involving unusual edge cases
    - Pure computation without requiring interpretation
    - Problems that can be solved by calculator without understanding

# ==============================================================================
# GRADING THRESHOLDS
# ==============================================================================

grading:
  passing_score: 70

  thresholds:
    exercises: 70
    quizzes: 65
    exams: 65

  rationale: >
    Standard passing threshold for a foundational math course. Computational
    accuracy is important but some arithmetic errors are acceptable as long as
    the method is correct. Quiz threshold slightly lower because multiple-choice
    format can be tricky even with good understanding.

# ==============================================================================
# EXERCISE SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exercises:
  rationale: >
    Linear algebra exercises balance computation (performing algorithms) with
    conceptual understanding (interpreting results). Students need practice with
    both types. Written exercises allow for proof-style problems and short-answer
    explanations that complement pure computation.

  types:
    coding_with_tests: "0%"
    coding_ai_evaluated: "0%"
    written: "100%"
    justification: >
      Pure mathematics subject. All exercises are written—either computational
      (show all work) or conceptual (prove, explain, interpret). AI evaluation
      checks both correctness of answers and validity of reasoning.

  per_topic:
    minimum: 14
    target: 16
    maximum: 18
    justification: >
      Standard exercise count. Linear algebra benefits from volume of practice
      because computational fluency requires repetition. Each exercise can be
      completed in 10-20 minutes on average.

  difficulty_distribution:
    1: 2
    2: 4
    3: 5
    4: 3
    5: 2
    justification: >
      Moderate skew toward middle difficulties. D1-D2 exercises are straightforward
      computations. D3 exercises combine concepts or require interpretation.
      D4-D5 exercises involve proofs or multi-step problems.

# ==============================================================================
# QUIZ SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

quizzes:
  rationale: >
    Quizzes test both conceptual understanding and basic computational ability.
    They catch students who can follow algorithms mechanically but don't understand
    the underlying concepts. Quick recall of definitions and properties is essential.

  per_topic:
    count: 3
    questions_each: 5
    justification: >
      Standard quiz count. Three quizzes per topic allows progression: Quiz A
      (definitions and basic computations), Quiz B (applying concepts),
      Quiz C (interpreting results and edge cases).

  question_types:
    multiple_choice: "50%"
    true_false: "20%"
    fill_blank: "20%"
    code_output: "0%"
    coding: "0%"
    written: "10%"
    justification: >
      Heavy on multiple choice to test conceptual understanding and common
      misconceptions. True/false to address frequent errors (matrix multiplication
      commutativity, invertibility conditions). Fill-blank for key values
      (determinants, eigenvalues). Some written for short computations.

# ==============================================================================
# EXAM SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exams:
  rationale: >
    Exams combine computational problems with conceptual questions. Students should
    spend 2-4 minutes per question on average. Computation problems test fluency;
    conceptual problems test understanding. Mix ensures students can't pass by
    memorizing algorithms alone.

  midterm:
    questions:
      minimum: 24
      target: 28
      maximum: 32
    duration_minutes: 90
    format: >
      10-12 computational problems (row reduction, matrix operations, determinants),
      10-12 conceptual multiple choice (definitions, properties, interpretations),
      4-6 short answer (find basis, prove linear independence, explain result).
    coverage: "Topics 1-4: Systems, matrices, vector spaces, linear independence"

  final:
    questions:
      minimum: 38
      target: 42
      maximum: 46
    duration_minutes: 120
    format: >
      15-18 computational problems (including eigenvalues/eigenvectors),
      15-18 conceptual multiple choice (comprehensive),
      8-10 short answer (transformations, diagonalization, applications).
      At least one problem integrating multiple topics.
    coverage: "Comprehensive: all 7 topics with emphasis on later topics"
    cumulative: true

# ==============================================================================
# PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

projects:
  required: false
  count: 0
  rationale: >
    Linear algebra traditionally assesses via problem sets and exams rather than
    projects. The computational exercises provide sufficient practice with
    algorithms. Projects are optional enhancements (e.g., MATLAB/Python applications)
    but not required for the core curriculum.

# ==============================================================================
# SUBJECT-SPECIFIC RED FLAGS
# ==============================================================================

red_flags:
  - Exercise requires computing determinant of 5×5 or larger matrix by hand
  - Quiz question asks to memorize specific matrix entries from an example
  - Content shows row operations without clear notation of which operations were applied
  - Proof exercise asks for verbatim reproduction of a theorem proof from content
  - Exercise difficulty marked as 1-2 but requires understanding of eigenvalues/eigenvectors
  - Eigenvalue problem with matrices larger than 4×4 (too computationally intensive)
  - Geometric interpretation missing from transformation problems

# ==============================================================================
# NOTES
# ==============================================================================

notes: >
  Linear algebra is a gateway to both abstract mathematics (vector spaces, operators)
  and applied mathematics (data science, machine learning, graphics). Content should
  emphasize both perspectives: the formal structure (axioms, proofs) and practical
  applications (solving systems, data analysis). Students should finish understanding
  both "how to compute" and "why the computation works." Geometric intuition in ℝ² and
  ℝ³ helps motivate abstract definitions—use visualizations where appropriate.
