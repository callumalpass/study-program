id: math304
title: Abstract Algebra
category: math

role:
  level: advanced
  transformation: >
    From "algebra is solving equations" to "I understand the deep structures
    underlying arithmetic and can construct proofs about groups, rings, and
    fields." Students develop rigorous proof skills while seeing how abstract
    structures connect to modern cryptography.

# ==============================================================================
# PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH
# ==============================================================================

pedagogy:
  knowledge_type: proof-based

  mastery_indicators:
    - Verifies group axioms for novel algebraic structures
    - Constructs subgroup lattices and identifies normal subgroups
    - Computes with cycle notation and determines permutation parity
    - Applies Lagrange's Theorem and its corollaries to deduce group properties
    - Proves statements about homomorphisms and applies isomorphism theorems
    - Identifies ring-theoretic properties (units, zero divisors, ideals)
    - Applies number-theoretic results to cryptographic protocols

  common_struggles:
    - Verifying all four group axioms (especially associativity)
    - Confusing subgroup with subset (forgetting closure under operation)
    - Cycle multiplication direction (left-to-right vs right-to-left)
    - Normal subgroup definition (gHg^-1 = H vs gH = Hg)
    - Distinguishing isomorphism from homomorphism
    - Ring axioms vs field axioms (when multiplicative inverses exist)
    - Connecting abstract theory to concrete cryptographic algorithms

# ==============================================================================
# CONTENT STANDARDS
# ==============================================================================

content:
  subtopic_requirements:
    - Every definition accompanied by multiple examples (familiar and unfamiliar)
    - Non-examples and counterexamples for major definitions
    - Proof sketches before formal proofs for complex theorems
    - Explicit statements of which proof technique is being used
    - Connections between algebraic structures and prior knowledge
    - Cryptographic applications shown with concrete numerical examples

  conventions:
    - LaTeX for all mathematical expressions
    - Standard group notation (G, H, K for groups; e for identity; a^-1 for inverse)
    - Cycle notation for permutations: (1 2 3) means 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1
    - Ring notation (R, S for rings; 0, 1 for additive/multiplicative identities)
    - Proofs begin with "Proof:" and end with box

# ==============================================================================
# ASSESSMENT PHILOSOPHY
# ==============================================================================

assessment:
  philosophy: >
    Abstract algebra mastery requires constructing proofs, not just recognizing
    correct ones. Exams test both conceptual understanding (definitions, examples,
    counterexamples) and proof construction. Cryptographic applications demonstrate
    that abstract theory has concrete utility. Assessment rewards clear logical
    structure even when conclusions aren't fully reached.

  measures:
    - Correct verification of algebraic structure axioms
    - Construction of proofs using standard techniques
    - Application of major theorems (Lagrange, Isomorphism Theorems)
    - Recognition of structure-preserving maps
    - Numerical computation in cryptographic contexts

  anti_patterns:
    - Asking students to reproduce specific textbook proofs verbatim
    - Pure computation without conceptual justification
    - Questions answerable by memorization rather than understanding
    - Trick questions exploiting notational ambiguity
    - Cryptography questions requiring implementation rather than math

# ==============================================================================
# GRADING THRESHOLDS
# ==============================================================================

grading:
  passing_score: 65

  thresholds:
    exercises: 60
    quizzes: 65
    exams: 60

  rationale: >
    Slightly lower passing threshold than introductory courses because abstract
    algebra proofs are challenging. A student who can construct 60% of proofs
    correctly has demonstrated significant mathematical maturity. However, the
    threshold ensures students engage seriously with the material.

# ==============================================================================
# EXERCISE SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exercises:
  rationale: >
    Exercises develop proof construction skills through graduated difficulty.
    Early exercises verify definitions with specific examples. Intermediate
    exercises require short proofs. Advanced exercises require multi-step
    arguments or creative problem-solving. Cryptography exercises include
    numerical computation alongside theoretical justification.

  types:
    coding_with_tests: "0%"
    coding_ai_evaluated: "0%"
    written: "100%"
    justification: >
      Pure mathematics subject. All exercises are proofs, verification of
      axioms, counterexample construction, or cryptographic computation.
      AI evaluation compares student proofs to reference solutions for
      logical validity and completeness.

  per_topic:
    minimum: 14
    target: 16
    maximum: 18
    justification: >
      Standard base count appropriate for proof-based content. Each exercise
      requires substantial thought and writing. 16 exercises per topic provides
      sufficient variety across difficulty levels without overwhelming students.

  difficulty_distribution:
    1: 2
    2: 3
    3: 5
    4: 4
    5: 2
    justification: >
      Skewed toward medium difficulty because abstract algebra has a high floor.
      Difficulty 1-2 exercises verify definitions and compute with examples.
      Difficulty 3-4 require short proofs using standard techniques.
      Difficulty 5 exercises require creative insight or multi-theorem arguments.

# ==============================================================================
# QUIZ SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

quizzes:
  rationale: >
    Quizzes assess definition recall, example recognition, and short reasoning
    before students attempt full proof exercises. They catch gaps in foundational
    understanding early and build confidence with algebraic structures.

  per_topic:
    count: 3
    questions_each: 5
    justification: >
      Standard base count. Three quizzes per topic provide staged assessment:
      fundamentals (definitions), application (examples/computations), and
      mastery (short proofs/counterexamples). 15 questions per topic ensures
      comprehensive coverage.

  question_types:
    multiple_choice: "50%"
    true_false: "20%"
    fill_blank: "15%"
    code_output: "0%"
    coding: "0%"
    written: "15%"
    justification: >
      Heavy on multiple choice for conceptual testing (which structure is a
      group, which function is a homomorphism). True/false for common
      misconceptions. Fill-blank for precise definitions. Limited written
      for very short proofs or justifications.

# ==============================================================================
# EXAM SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exams:
  rationale: >
    Exams require proof construction under time pressure, testing both speed
    and understanding. Mix of question types: quick conceptual questions, medium
    computation, and extended proof problems. Time allows 3-4 minutes per
    question on average, with flexibility for longer proofs.

  midterm:
    questions:
      minimum: 22
      target: 26
      maximum: 30
    duration_minutes: 75
    format: >
      10-12 multiple choice conceptual questions, 4-6 true/false addressing
      common misconceptions, 4-5 short computation or fill-blank, 4-6 short
      proof or verification problems. Emphasis on group theory foundations.
    coverage: "Topics 1-4: Groups, Cyclic Groups, Permutations, Cosets/Lagrange"

  final:
    questions:
      minimum: 36
      target: 42
      maximum: 48
    duration_minutes: 120
    format: >
      Comprehensive coverage of all topics. 16-18 multiple choice, 6-8 true/false,
      6-8 fill-blank/computation, 10-12 proof problems. Ring and field theory
      and cryptographic applications weighted appropriately in later sections.
      At least one problem requiring synthesis of multiple concepts.
    coverage: "Comprehensive: all 7 topics with emphasis on connections"
    cumulative: true

# ==============================================================================
# PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

projects:
  required: false
  count: 0
  rationale: >
    Pure mathematics courses traditionally assess via problem sets and exams
    rather than projects. The cryptography topic provides applied context without
    requiring implementation. Students demonstrate mastery through proof
    construction in exercises and exams.

# ==============================================================================
# SUBJECT-SPECIFIC RED FLAGS
# ==============================================================================

red_flags:
  - Exercise requires theorem not yet proven in the curriculum
  - Proof problem has unique "trick" not generalizable to other problems
  - Cryptography problem requires programming rather than mathematical analysis
  - Quiz question tests obscure result rather than fundamental concept
  - Exercise asks for computation without theoretical understanding
  - Content uses nonstandard notation without definition
  - Proof in content uses hand-waving ("clearly", "obviously") without justification

# ==============================================================================
# NOTES
# ==============================================================================

notes: >
  Abstract Algebra bridges pure mathematics and computer science applications.
  Content should maintain rigor while showing why these structures matter:
  groups arise in symmetry and error correction, rings in polynomial algebra,
  fields in cryptography. The cryptography topic (Topic 7) is especially
  important for CS students—show how RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and elliptic curves
  rely on the algebraic foundations from earlier topics. Students should leave
  understanding both the abstract beauty and practical utility of algebraic
  structures.
