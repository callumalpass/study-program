# Ideals

## Introduction

Ideals play the same fundamental role in ring theory that normal subgroups play in group theory. Just as normal subgroups are exactly the kernels of group homomorphisms and allow construction of quotient groups, ideals are precisely the kernels of ring homomorphisms and enable the construction of quotient rings.

The concept emerged in the 19th century through the work of Dedekind and others studying algebraic number theory. Dedekind introduced "ideal numbers" to restore unique factorization in rings where it failed, leading to the modern notion of ideals. Today, ideals are indispensable tools in commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, and algebraic number theory.

## Definition

**Definition**: A subset $I \subseteq R$ is a **(two-sided) ideal** if:
1. $(I, +)$ is a subgroup of $(R, +)$
   - Equivalently: $I \neq \emptyset$ and $a - b \in I$ for all $a, b \in I$
2. **Absorption property**: For all $r \in R$ and $a \in I$: $ra \in I$ and $ar \in I$

The second property is crucial: multiplying any ring element by any ideal element keeps you in the ideal. This "absorption" makes ideals behave nicely under quotient construction.

**Notation**: We often write $I \triangleleft R$ to denote that $I$ is an ideal of $R$.

**Left and right ideals**: In non-commutative rings, we distinguish:
- **Left ideal**: $ra \in I$ for all $r \in R, a \in I$
- **Right ideal**: $ar \in I$ for all $r \in R, a \in I$
- **Two-sided ideal**: Both left and right ideal

For commutative rings, all ideals are automatically two-sided.

## Motivation and Comparison with Subgroups

Why the absorption property? Consider trying to form a quotient ring $R/S$ for subring $S$:
- Cosets: $r + S = \{r + s : s \in S\}$
- Multiplication: $(r_1 + S)(r_2 + S) = r_1 r_2 + S$

For this to be well-defined, we need: if $s \in S$, then $r_1 s, s r_2 \in S$ for all $r_1, r_2 \in R$.

This is exactly the ideal property! Without it, quotient rings don't work properly.

**Key difference from groups**: In groups, normal subgroups satisfy $gNg^{-1} = N$. In rings, ideals satisfy the stronger absorption property $rI \subseteq I$ and $Ir \subseteq I$ (no inverse needed).

## Examples

### Example 1: Trivial Ideals

Every ring $R$ has two trivial ideals:
- $\{0\}$ (the zero ideal)
- $R$ (the whole ring)

These are always ideals, but usually uninteresting.

### Example 2: $n\mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$

All multiples of $n$ form an ideal of $\mathbb{Z}$:
$$n\mathbb{Z} = \{nk : k \in \mathbb{Z}\} = \{\ldots, -2n, -n, 0, n, 2n, \ldots\}$$

**Verification**:
1. Subgroup: If $na, nb \in n\mathbb{Z}$, then $na - nb = n(a-b) \in n\mathbb{Z}$
2. Absorption: If $na \in n\mathbb{Z}$ and $r \in \mathbb{Z}$, then $r \cdot na = n(ra) \in n\mathbb{Z}$

**Remarkable fact**: These are the ONLY ideals of $\mathbb{Z}$ (proven below).

### Example 3: Polynomial Ideal

In polynomial ring $R[x]$, the set of all polynomials with zero constant term:
$$I = \{a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x : a_i \in R\}$$

is an ideal (multiples of $x$).

More generally, $\langle f(x) \rangle = \{g(x)f(x) : g \in R[x]\}$ (all multiples of $f$) forms an ideal.

### Example 4: Even Integers

$2\mathbb{Z}$ (even integers) is an ideal of $\mathbb{Z}$.

Note: $2\mathbb{Z}$ is a subring but also an ideal—the absorption property adds structure beyond being a subring.

### Example 5: Matrix Ring

In $M_2(\mathbb{R})$, the set of matrices with zero second row:
$$I = \left\{\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} : a, b \in \mathbb{R}\right\}$$

is a left ideal but NOT a right ideal.

This shows the left/right distinction matters in non-commutative rings.

### Non-Example

$\mathbb{Z}$ is a subring of $\mathbb{Q}$ but NOT an ideal. Why?

Take $r = \frac{1}{2} \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $a = 1 \in \mathbb{Z}$. Then:
$$ra = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{2} \notin \mathbb{Z}$$

So $\mathbb{Z}$ fails the absorption property.

## Principal Ideals

**Definition**: An ideal generated by a single element $a$ is called a **principal ideal**:
$$\langle a \rangle = \{ra : r \in R\}$$

In commutative rings: $\langle a \rangle = Ra = \{ra : r \in R\}$.

In general rings: $\langle a \rangle = RaR = \{r_1 a r_2 : r_1, r_2 \in R\}$ (two-sided ideal generated by $a$).

**Notation**: Also written $(a)$ or $aR$ (depending on context).

### Examples

- In $\mathbb{Z}$: $\langle n \rangle = n\mathbb{Z}$ (all multiples of $n$)
- In $\mathbb{R}[x]$: $\langle x^2 + 1 \rangle = \{f(x)(x^2 + 1) : f \in \mathbb{R}[x]\}$
- In any ring: $\langle 0 \rangle = \{0\}$ and $\langle 1 \rangle = R$ (if unity exists)

**Principal Ideal Domain (PID)**: A ring where every ideal is principal.

Examples: $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{F}[x]$ (polynomials over a field).

Non-example: $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ (ideal $\langle 2, x \rangle = \{2f(x) + xg(x)\}$ is not principal).

## Ideal Operations

**Sum**: $I + J = \{a + b : a \in I, b \in J\}$ (smallest ideal containing $I$ and $J$)

**Product**: $IJ = \{\sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i : a_i \in I, b_i \in J\}$ (all finite sums of products)

**Intersection**: $I \cap J$ (also an ideal)

### Properties

- $I + J$ is the smallest ideal containing both $I$ and $J$
- $IJ \subseteq I \cap J$ (products are "smaller" than intersections)
- If $I + J = R$, we say $I$ and $J$ are **comaximal**

**Example**: In $\mathbb{Z}$:
- $\langle 6 \rangle + \langle 10 \rangle = \langle \gcd(6,10) \rangle = \langle 2 \rangle$
- $\langle 6 \rangle \cap \langle 10 \rangle = \langle \text{lcm}(6,10) \rangle = \langle 30 \rangle$
- $\langle 6 \rangle \cdot \langle 10 \rangle = \langle 60 \rangle$

## Every Ideal in $\mathbb{Z}$ is Principal

**Theorem**: Every ideal $I$ of $\mathbb{Z}$ has the form $I = n\mathbb{Z}$ for some $n \geq 0$.

**Proof**: If $I = \{0\}$, then $I = 0\mathbb{Z}$.

Otherwise, $I$ contains some non-zero integers. Let $n$ be the smallest positive integer in $I$.

**Claim**: $I = n\mathbb{Z}$.

($\supseteq$) Since $n \in I$ and $I$ is an ideal, $kn \in I$ for all $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. Thus $n\mathbb{Z} \subseteq I$.

($\subseteq$) Let $a \in I$. By division algorithm, $a = qn + r$ where $0 \leq r < n$.

Then $r = a - qn \in I$ (since $a \in I$ and $qn \in I$).

By minimality of $n$, we must have $r = 0$. Thus $a = qn \in n\mathbb{Z}$. $\square$

**Consequence**: $\mathbb{Z}$ is a principal ideal domain (PID).

## Maximal and Prime Ideals

Two special types of ideals play crucial roles:

### Maximal Ideals

**Definition**: Proper ideal $M \triangleleft R$ is **maximal** if whenever $I$ is an ideal with $M \subseteq I \subseteq R$, then either $I = M$ or $I = R$.

Equivalently: $M$ is maximal among proper ideals (no proper ideal strictly contains it).

**Theorem**: $R/M$ is a field if and only if $M$ is a maximal ideal.

### Examples

- In $\mathbb{Z}$: $p\mathbb{Z}$ is maximal if and only if $p$ is prime
  - $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} = \mathbb{Z}_p$ is a field when $p$ is prime
- In $\mathbb{R}[x]$: $\langle x^2 + 1 \rangle$ is maximal
  - $\mathbb{R}[x]/\langle x^2 + 1 \rangle \cong \mathbb{C}$ (a field)

### Prime Ideals

**Definition**: Proper ideal $P \triangleleft R$ is **prime** if whenever $ab \in P$, then $a \in P$ or $b \in P$.

**Theorem**: $R/P$ is an integral domain if and only if $P$ is a prime ideal.

### Examples

- In $\mathbb{Z}$: $p\mathbb{Z}$ is prime if and only if $p$ is prime (same condition as maximal!)
- In $\mathbb{Z}[x]$: $\langle x \rangle$ is prime (quotient $\mathbb{Z}[x]/\langle x \rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}$ is integral domain)

**Relationship**: Every maximal ideal is prime, but not conversely.

**Example**: In $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, the ideal $\langle x \rangle$ is prime but not maximal (since $\langle x \rangle \subset \langle 2, x \rangle \subset \mathbb{Z}[x]$).

## Kernels of Ring Homomorphisms

**Theorem**: If $\phi: R \to S$ is a ring homomorphism, then $\ker(\phi) = \{r \in R : \phi(r) = 0\}$ is an ideal of $R$.

**Proof**:
1. **Subgroup**: Standard argument shows $\ker(\phi)$ is subgroup of $(R, +)$
2. **Absorption**: If $a \in \ker(\phi)$ and $r \in R$, then:
   $$\phi(ra) = \phi(r)\phi(a) = \phi(r) \cdot 0 = 0$$
   So $ra \in \ker(\phi)$. Similarly $ar \in \ker(\phi)$. $\square$

**Converse**: Every ideal arises as the kernel of some homomorphism (the canonical projection $R \to R/I$).

This parallels the situation with normal subgroups and group homomorphisms.

## Applications

### Algebraic Geometry

Ideals in polynomial rings correspond to algebraic varieties:
- Ideal $I \subseteq \mathbb{C}[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$
- Variety $V(I) = \{(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \in \mathbb{C}^n : f(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = 0 \text{ for all } f \in I\}$

This connection forms the foundation of algebraic geometry.

### Algebraic Number Theory

Ideal theory was developed to restore unique factorization in rings of algebraic integers where element-wise factorization fails.

Example: In $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$, we have $6 = 2 \cdot 3 = (1+\sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5})$, but ideal factorization is unique.

## Summary

- **Ideal**: subset $I \subseteq R$ that is additive subgroup with $rI, Ir \subseteq I$
- **Principal ideals**: generated by single element $\langle a \rangle = Ra$
- **Every ideal in $\mathbb{Z}$ is principal**: $I = n\mathbb{Z}$
- **Maximal ideals**: $R/M$ is a field
- **Prime ideals**: $R/P$ is an integral domain
- **Kernels**: Every kernel of ring homomorphism is an ideal
- **Applications**: foundation for quotient rings, algebraic geometry, number theory

Ideals are fundamental for ring theory, just as normal subgroups are for group theory. They enable quotient constructions and connect abstract algebra to geometry and number theory.

5. Every maximal ideal is prime, but not conversely
6. Ideals are exactly the kernels of ring homomorphisms
