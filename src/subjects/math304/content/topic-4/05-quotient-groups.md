# Quotient Groups

Quotient groups (also called factor groups) are one of the most powerful constructions in group theory. They allow us to "collapse" a normal subgroup to the identity, creating a smaller group that captures the essential structure of the original group modulo the collapsed subgroup. This construction is fundamental to the isomorphism theorems and pervades all of abstract algebra.

## The Construction of Quotient Groups

**Definition**: Let $G$ be a group and $N \triangleleft G$ a normal subgroup. The **quotient group** (or **factor group**) $G/N$ is defined as follows:

- **Elements**: The elements of $G/N$ are the cosets of $N$ in $G$:
  $$G/N = \{gN : g \in G\}$$

- **Operation**: The group operation on cosets is defined by:
  $$(aN)(bN) = (ab)N$$

The key insight is that this operation is well-defined only when $N$ is normal.

## Why Normality is Required

**Theorem**: The coset multiplication $(aN)(bN) = (ab)N$ is well-defined if and only if $N \triangleleft G$.

**Proof**: "Well-defined" means that the result doesn't depend on the choice of coset representatives. Suppose $a_1N = a_2N$ and $b_1N = b_2N$. We need to show $(a_1b_1)N = (a_2b_2)N$.

From $a_1N = a_2N$, we have $a_2 = a_1n_1$ for some $n_1 \in N$.
From $b_1N = b_2N$, we have $b_2 = b_1n_2$ for some $n_2 \in N$.

Then:
$$a_2b_2 = (a_1n_1)(b_1n_2) = a_1(n_1b_1)n_2$$

For this to equal $a_1b_1$ times something in $N$, we need $n_1b_1 = b_1n_3$ for some $n_3 \in N$. This is equivalent to $b_1^{-1}n_1b_1 \in N$, which holds for all $b_1$ if and only if $N$ is normal.

When $N$ is normal: $a_2b_2 = a_1b_1(b_1^{-1}n_1b_1)n_2 \in a_1b_1N$, so $(a_2b_2)N = (a_1b_1)N$. $\square$

## Verification of Group Axioms

**Theorem**: If $N \triangleleft G$, then $G/N$ with coset multiplication forms a group.

**Proof**: We verify the four group axioms:

1. **Closure**: For any $aN, bN \in G/N$, we have $(aN)(bN) = (ab)N$, which is a coset of $N$, hence in $G/N$.

2. **Associativity**: For any $aN, bN, cN \in G/N$:
   $$((aN)(bN))(cN) = (ab)N \cdot cN = ((ab)c)N = (a(bc))N = aN \cdot (bc)N = (aN)((bN)(cN))$$
   Associativity in $G/N$ follows from associativity in $G$.

3. **Identity**: The coset $eN = N$ serves as the identity:
   $$(aN)(N) = (ae)N = aN \text{ and } (N)(aN) = (ea)N = aN$$

4. **Inverses**: For any $aN \in G/N$, the inverse is $a^{-1}N$:
   $$(aN)(a^{-1}N) = (aa^{-1})N = eN = N$$

Therefore $G/N$ is a group. $\square$

## The Order of a Quotient Group

**Theorem**: For a finite group $G$ with normal subgroup $N$:
$$|G/N| = [G:N] = \frac{|G|}{|N|}$$

This follows from Lagrange's theorem: the number of cosets equals $|G|/|N|$.

**Example**: In $S_3$ with $A_3 \triangleleft S_3$, we have $|S_3/A_3| = 6/3 = 2$.

## Fundamental Examples

### Example 1: Integers Modulo $n$

The quotient $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ consists of the cosets:
$$\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} = \{0 + n\mathbb{Z}, 1 + n\mathbb{Z}, 2 + n\mathbb{Z}, \ldots, (n-1) + n\mathbb{Z}\}$$

The operation is:
$$(a + n\mathbb{Z}) + (b + n\mathbb{Z}) = (a+b) + n\mathbb{Z}$$

This is precisely the group $\mathbb{Z}_n$ of integers modulo $n$ that we've used throughout mathematics. The quotient construction explains why modular arithmetic forms a group.

### Example 2: $S_3/A_3$

The alternating group $A_3 = \{e, (1\,2\,3), (1\,3\,2)\}$ is normal in $S_3$.

The cosets are:
- $A_3 = \{e, (1\,2\,3), (1\,3\,2)\}$ (even permutations)
- $(1\,2)A_3 = \{(1\,2), (1\,3), (2\,3)\}$ (odd permutations)

The quotient $S_3/A_3$ has two elements with multiplication table:
| · | $A_3$ | $(1\,2)A_3$ |
|---|-------|-------------|
| $A_3$ | $A_3$ | $(1\,2)A_3$ |
| $(1\,2)A_3$ | $(1\,2)A_3$ | $A_3$ |

This is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_2$: even × even = even, odd × odd = even, even × odd = odd.

### Example 3: The Circle Group $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$

The quotient $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ identifies real numbers that differ by an integer:
$$x \sim y \iff x - y \in \mathbb{Z}$$

Each coset can be represented by a unique element in $[0, 1)$. Geometrically, this quotient is the circle group $S^1$, obtained by "wrapping" the real line around a circle.

### Example 4: Computing in $\mathbb{Z}_{12}/\langle 4 \rangle$

Let $N = \langle 4 \rangle = \{0, 4, 8\}$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$. The cosets are:
- $\bar{0} = \{0, 4, 8\}$
- $\bar{1} = \{1, 5, 9\}$
- $\bar{2} = \{2, 6, 10\}$
- $\bar{3} = \{3, 7, 11\}$

The quotient $\mathbb{Z}_{12}/\langle 4 \rangle$ has order $12/3 = 4$ and is cyclic, generated by $\bar{1}$.

We can verify: $\bar{1} + \bar{1} = \bar{2}$, $\bar{1} + \bar{1} + \bar{1} = \bar{3}$, $\bar{1} + \bar{1} + \bar{1} + \bar{1} = \bar{0}$.

Thus $\mathbb{Z}_{12}/\langle 4 \rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}_4$.

## The Natural Projection Homomorphism

**Definition**: The **natural projection** (or **canonical homomorphism**) $\pi: G \to G/N$ is defined by:
$$\pi(g) = gN$$

**Theorem**: The natural projection $\pi$ is a surjective homomorphism with $\ker(\pi) = N$.

**Proof**:
- **Homomorphism**: $\pi(ab) = (ab)N = (aN)(bN) = \pi(a)\pi(b)$
- **Surjective**: Every coset $gN$ is in the image since $\pi(g) = gN$
- **Kernel**: $\ker(\pi) = \{g \in G : \pi(g) = N\} = \{g \in G : gN = N\} = N$

$\square$

The natural projection shows that every normal subgroup arises as the kernel of some homomorphism.

## Connection to the First Isomorphism Theorem

The quotient construction is intimately connected to the First Isomorphism Theorem:

**First Isomorphism Theorem**: If $\phi: G \to H$ is a homomorphism, then:
$$G/\ker(\phi) \cong \text{Im}(\phi)$$

This theorem says that every quotient group is isomorphic to an image of a homomorphism, and conversely, every homomorphic image is isomorphic to a quotient. The natural projection is the universal example: it realizes $G/N$ as the image of $\pi$.

## Quotients and Group Structure

Quotient groups are powerful tools for analyzing group structure:

1. **Simplification**: Taking quotients "mods out" structure, producing simpler groups.

2. **Classification**: Groups can be understood via their normal subgroups and corresponding quotients.

3. **Composition Series**: Every finite group has a chain of normal subgroups $\{e\} = N_0 \triangleleft N_1 \triangleleft \cdots \triangleleft N_k = G$ where each quotient $N_{i+1}/N_i$ is simple.

4. **Abelianization**: For any group $G$, the quotient $G/[G,G]$ by the commutator subgroup is the largest abelian quotient of $G$.

## Key Takeaways

- **Quotient group $G/N$** consists of cosets of a normal subgroup $N$, with operation $(aN)(bN) = (ab)N$
- **Normality is essential**: The operation is well-defined only when $N \triangleleft G$
- **Order formula**: $|G/N| = |G|/|N|$
- **Natural projection** $\pi: G \to G/N$ is a surjective homomorphism with kernel $N$
- **$\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} = \mathbb{Z}_n$**: Modular arithmetic is a quotient construction
- **First Isomorphism Theorem** connects quotients to homomorphic images

Quotient groups transform the abstract concept of "identifying elements" into a precise algebraic construction, providing one of the most powerful techniques in group theory.
