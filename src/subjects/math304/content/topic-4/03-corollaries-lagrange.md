# Corollaries of Lagrange's Theorem

Lagrange's Theorem is one of the most powerful results in finite group theory, and its consequences permeate nearly every aspect of the subject. This section explores the major corollaries and their applications, demonstrating how a single theorem about subgroup orders leads to a rich theory with practical computational tools.

## Fundamental Corollaries

### Corollary 1: Element Order Divides Group Order

**Statement**: If $G$ is finite and $g \in G$, then $|g|$ divides $|G|$.

**Proof**: The cyclic subgroup generated by $g$, denoted $\langle g \rangle = \{e, g, g^2, \ldots, g^{k-1}\}$ where $k = |g|$, is a subgroup of $G$. By Lagrange's Theorem, $|\langle g \rangle|$ divides $|G|$. But $|\langle g \rangle| = |g|$ by definition of element order. $\square$

**Application**: In a group of order 20, possible element orders are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20 (divisors of 20).

An element cannot have order 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, or any other non-divisor of 20. This immediately constrains the structure of elements we need to consider.

**Example**: In $\mathbb{Z}_{20}$, the element 6 has order $20/\gcd(20, 6) = 20/2 = 10$, which indeed divides 20. The element 8 has order $20/\gcd(20, 8) = 20/4 = 5$, also dividing 20.

### Corollary 2: $g^{|G|} = e$

**Statement**: For any $g$ in finite group $G$: $g^{|G|} = e$.

**Proof**: Let $|g| = k$. By Corollary 1, $k | |G|$, so we can write $|G| = km$ for some integer $m \geq 1$. Thus:
$$g^{|G|} = g^{km} = (g^k)^m = e^m = e$$
$\square$

This is a remarkably simple but powerful result. Every element, when raised to the power of the group order, becomes the identity.

**Applications**:

1. **Fermat's Little Theorem**: Consider $G = (\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^* = \{1, 2, \ldots, p-1\}$ under multiplication mod $p$ (where $p$ is prime). This group has order $p-1$. By Corollary 2, for any $a \in G$:
   $$a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$$
   Multiplying by $a$ gives $a^p \equiv a \pmod{p}$ for all integers $a$.

2. **Euler's Theorem**: Consider $G = (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^*$, the group of units mod $n$. This group has order $\phi(n)$ (Euler's totient function). For $\gcd(a,n) = 1$:
   $$a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$$

3. **RSA Cryptography**: The security of RSA encryption relies on this corollary applied to modular arithmetic.

### Corollary 3: Prime Order Groups Are Cyclic

**Statement**: If $|G| = p$ (prime), then $G \cong \mathbb{Z}_p$.

**Proof**: Pick any non-identity element $g \in G$. Then $|g| > 1$ and $|g|$ divides $p$ by Corollary 1. Since $p$ is prime, its only positive divisors are 1 and $p$. Since $|g| \neq 1$ (as $g \neq e$), we must have $|g| = p$. Therefore $|\langle g \rangle| = p = |G|$, which means $\langle g \rangle = G$. Thus $G$ is cyclic, and all cyclic groups of the same order are isomorphic. $\square$

**Example**: All groups of order 7 are isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_7$. There is essentially only one group structure of order 7 (up to isomorphism).

**Consequence**: This provides a complete classification of groups of prime order. Unlike composite orders (where multiple non-isomorphic groups may exist), prime orders have unique group structures.

## Index Calculations

### Corollary 4: Index Formula

**Statement**: For finite groups, $[G : H] = |G|/|H|$.

**Proof**: This follows immediately from Lagrange's Theorem: $|G| = |H| \cdot [G:H]$, so $[G:H] = |G|/|H|$. $\square$

**Example**: $[S_4 : A_4] = 24/12 = 2$.

This tells us there are exactly 2 cosets of $A_4$ in $S_4$: $A_4$ itself (even permutations) and $(1\,2)A_4$ (odd permutations).

**Another Example**: In $\mathbb{Z}$, we have $[\mathbb{Z} : n\mathbb{Z}] = n$. The cosets are $n\mathbb{Z}, 1 + n\mathbb{Z}, 2 + n\mathbb{Z}, \ldots, (n-1) + n\mathbb{Z}$, giving exactly $n$ distinct cosets.

### Corollary 5: Tower Law

**Statement**: If $K \leq H \leq G$, then $[G:K] = [G:H][H:K]$.

**Proof**: The cosets of $K$ in $G$ can be organized hierarchically. Each coset of $H$ in $G$ can be subdivided into $[H:K]$ cosets of $K$. Since there are $[G:H]$ cosets of $H$ in $G$, the total number of cosets of $K$ in $G$ is the product: $[G:K] = [G:H][H:K]$. $\square$

**Alternative Proof Using Orders**: In finite groups:
$$[G:K] = \frac{|G|}{|K|} = \frac{|G|}{|H|} \cdot \frac{|H|}{|K|} = [G:H][H:K]$$

**Example**: Consider $\{0\} \leq 12\mathbb{Z} \leq 4\mathbb{Z} \leq \mathbb{Z}$.

We have:
- $[\mathbb{Z} : 4\mathbb{Z}] = 4$
- $[4\mathbb{Z} : 12\mathbb{Z}] = 3$

By the Tower Law: $[\mathbb{Z} : 12\mathbb{Z}] = 4 \cdot 3 = 12$. ✓

This matches the direct calculation: $\mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}$ has 12 distinct cosets.

## Existence Results

### Corollary 6: Subgroups of Prime Index

**Statement**: If $[G:H] = p$ (prime), then $H$ is a maximal subgroup (no proper subgroup strictly between $H$ and $G$).

**Proof**: Suppose there exists a subgroup $K$ with $H < K < G$ (proper containments). Then by the Tower Law:
$$[G:H] = [G:K][K:H]$$

Since both $[G:K] > 1$ (as $K \neq G$) and $[K:H] > 1$ (as $K \neq H$), we have $[G:H]$ as a product of two integers both greater than 1. This contradicts $[G:H] = p$ being prime. $\square$

**Example**: In $S_3$, the subgroup $A_3 = \{e, (1\,2\,3), (1\,3\,2)\}$ has index $[S_3:A_3] = 6/3 = 2$, which is prime. Therefore $A_3$ is maximal in $S_3$.

**Additional Consequence**: Subgroups of index 2 are always normal. Combined with this corollary, subgroups of index 2 are normal and maximal.

### Corollary 7: No Subgroup of Order 6 in $A_4$

$|A_4| = 12$. Suppose $H \leq A_4$ with $|H| = 6$. Then $[A_4:H] = 12/6 = 2$.

A classical result states that subgroups of index 2 are always normal. Therefore $H \triangleleft A_4$.

However, $A_4$ has no normal subgroup of order 6. This can be verified by examining the normal subgroups of $A_4$:
- $\{e\}$ (trivial)
- $V_4 = \{e, (1\,2)(3\,4), (1\,3)(2\,4), (1\,4)(2\,3)\}$ (Klein four-group, order 4)
- $A_4$ (whole group)

Since no normal subgroup of order 6 exists, our assumption must be false. Therefore $A_4$ has no subgroup of order 6. $\square$

This is the standard counterexample showing that Lagrange's Theorem has no converse.

## Non-Existence Results

**Limitation**: Lagrange's Theorem tells us that every subgroup order divides the group order, but does NOT guarantee that every divisor of the group order corresponds to an actual subgroup.

**General Principle**: If $d | |G|$, a subgroup of order $d$ may or may not exist.

**Example**: We've seen $A_4$ (order 12) has no subgroup of order 6, even though $6 | 12$.

**Contrast with Cyclic Groups**: Cyclic groups are special - they DO have a unique subgroup for each divisor. If $G$ is cyclic of order $n$, then for each $d | n$, there exists exactly one subgroup of order $d$.

## Applications to Specific Groups

### In Cyclic Groups

**Theorem**: If $G = \mathbb{Z}_n$, then $G$ has a unique subgroup of order $d$ for each divisor $d$ of $n$.

Specifically, the unique subgroup of order $d$ is $\langle n/d \rangle = \{0, n/d, 2n/d, \ldots, (d-1)n/d\}$.

**Example**: $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ has divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.
- Order 1: $\{0\} = \langle 0 \rangle$
- Order 2: $\{0, 6\} = \langle 6 \rangle$
- Order 3: $\{0, 4, 8\} = \langle 4 \rangle$
- Order 4: $\{0, 3, 6, 9\} = \langle 3 \rangle$
- Order 6: $\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\} = \langle 2 \rangle$
- Order 12: $\mathbb{Z}_{12} = \langle 1 \rangle$

### In Symmetric Groups

**Observation**: $S_n$ has subgroups of many orders, but not all divisors of $n!$.

For example, $|S_4| = 24 = 2^3 \cdot 3$. Divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.

$S_4$ has subgroups of orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. In this case, every divisor corresponds to a subgroup, but this is not guaranteed for all symmetric groups.

### In Dihedral Groups

$D_n$ has order $2n$. By Lagrange, subgroup orders must divide $2n$.

**Example**: $D_6$ has order 12. Possible subgroup orders: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.

$D_6$ has:
- 1 subgroup of order 1: $\{e\}$
- 7 subgroups of order 2 (reflections and rotation of order 2)
- 2 subgroups of order 3 (rotational subgroups)
- 1 subgroup of order 4 (no such subgroup exists in $D_6$? Actually, no)
- 3 subgroups of order 6
- 1 subgroup of order 12: $D_6$

## Counting Elements

### Corollary 8: Partition by Order

The elements of $G$ can be partitioned by their orders:
$$|G| = \sum_{d | |G|} \psi(d)$$

where $\psi(d)$ is the number of elements of order $d$ in $G$.

**For cyclic groups**: $\psi(d) = \phi(d)$ (Euler's totient function), which counts integers $1 \leq k \leq d$ with $\gcd(k, d) = 1$.

### Example

$\mathbb{Z}_{12}$: Verify that the sum of elements of each order equals 12.

- Order 1: $\phi(1) = 1$ (element: 0)
- Order 2: $\phi(2) = 1$ (element: 6)
- Order 3: $\phi(3) = 2$ (elements: 4, 8)
- Order 4: $\phi(4) = 2$ (elements: 3, 9)
- Order 6: $\phi(6) = 2$ (elements: 2, 10)
- Order 12: $\phi(12) = 4$ (elements: 1, 5, 7, 11)

Total: $1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 12$ ✓

## Impossibility Results

### Corollary 9: Order Restrictions

If $|G| = 15$, no element can have order 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, etc. (non-divisors of 15).

Possible element orders are only: 1, 3, 5, 15.

This dramatically restricts the possible structure of $G$. In fact, one can prove that every group of order 15 is cyclic (since $15 = 3 \cdot 5$ with 3 and 5 coprime).

### Corollary 10: Subgroup Constraints

In a group of order $p^2$ (where $p$ is prime), every non-identity element has order $p$ or $p^2$.

**Proof**: By Corollary 1, the order of any element divides $p^2$. The divisors of $p^2$ are 1, $p$, and $p^2$. Only the identity has order 1. $\square$

**Application**: This is used in proving that every group of order $p^2$ is abelian (a theorem from advanced group theory).

- The power formula $g^{|G|} = e$ unifies Fermat's Little Theorem and Euler's Theorem
- Groups of prime order have a unique structure (all cyclic and isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_p$)
- The index formula and Tower Law provide computational tools for working with nested subgroups
- Subgroups of prime index are necessarily maximal
- The converse of Lagrange's Theorem fails: not every divisor yields a subgroup
- In cyclic groups, every divisor corresponds to exactly one subgroup (unique existence)
- These corollaries are essential tools for analyzing finite group structure and prove indispensable in advanced topics like Sylow theorems and group classification

These corollaries make Lagrange's Theorem one of the most useful and frequently applied results in finite group theory, with applications ranging from number theory to cryptography.
