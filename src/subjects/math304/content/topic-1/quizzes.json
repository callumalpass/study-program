        "prompt": "Which of the following is NOT a required axiom for a set G with operation * to be a group?",
        "options": [
          "Closure: For all a, b in G, a * b is in G",
          "Associativity: For all a, b, c in G, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c)",

        "correctAnswer": "Commutativity: For all a, b in G, a * b = b * a",
        "explanation": "Commutativity is not required for a group. Groups that are commutative are called abelian groups, but non-abelian groups also exist (like matrix groups)."

        "correctAnswer": "7",
        "explanation": "The inverse of 5 in Z₁₂ under addition is the element x such that 5 + x ≡ 0 (mod 12). Since 5 + 7 = 12 ≡ 0 (mod 12), the inverse is 7."
