# Cyclic Groups Definition

## Motivation

Some groups have a particularly simple structure: every element can be expressed as a power of a single element. These groups, called cyclic groups, are among the most important and well-understood groups in abstract algebra.

Examples include:
- The integers under addition (generated by 1)
- The integers modulo $n$ under addition
- The rotational symmetries of a regular polygon
- The complex $n$th roots of unity

## Definition

**Definition**: A group $G$ is **cyclic** if there exists an element $a \in G$ such that every element of $G$ can be written as a power of $a$. We write:
$$G = \langle a \rangle = \{a^n : n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$$

The element $a$ is called a **generator** of $G$.

**In additive notation**: $G = \langle a \rangle = \{na : n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$.

**Note**: A cyclic group may have multiple generators, but it needs at least one.

## Basic Examples

### Example 1: The Integers

The group $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$ is cyclic with generator 1:
$$\mathbb{Z} = \langle 1 \rangle = \{\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\}$$

In fact, $\mathbb{Z} = \langle -1 \rangle$ as well, so both 1 and -1 are generators.

### Example 2: Integers Modulo $n$

For any positive integer $n$, the group $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is cyclic:
$$\mathbb{Z}_n = \langle 1 \rangle = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}$$

**Example**: $\mathbb{Z}_6 = \langle 1 \rangle$:
- $0 = 0 \cdot 1$
- $1 = 1 \cdot 1$
- $2 = 2 \cdot 1$
- $3 = 3 \cdot 1$
- $4 = 4 \cdot 1$
- $5 = 5 \cdot 1$

Also $\mathbb{Z}_6 = \langle 5 \rangle$ since:
- $0 = 0 \cdot 5$
- $1 = 5 \cdot 5 = 25 \equiv 1 \pmod{6}$
- $2 = 4 \cdot 5 = 20 \equiv 2 \pmod{6}$
- $3 = 3 \cdot 5 = 15 \equiv 3 \pmod{6}$
- etc.

### Example 3: Complex Roots of Unity

The $n$th roots of unity form a cyclic group:
$$\mu_n = \langle e^{2\pi i/n} \rangle = \{1, e^{2\pi i/n}, e^{4\pi i/n}, \ldots, e^{2\pi i(n-1)/n}\}$$

Let $\omega = e^{2\pi i/n}$. Then:
$$\mu_n = \{1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{n-1}\}$$

**Example**: For $n = 4$, let $\omega = i = e^{i\pi/2}$:
$$\mu_4 = \langle i \rangle = \{1, i, i^2, i^3\} = \{1, i, -1, -i\}$$

### Example 4: Rotational Symmetries

The rotational symmetries of a regular $n$-gon form a cyclic group of order $n$.

For a square ($n = 4$), let $r$ be rotation by 90°:
$$\{e, r, r^2, r^3\} = \langle r \rangle$$

## Finite vs Infinite Cyclic Groups

Cyclic groups come in two types:

**Infinite Cyclic Groups**: Groups like $\mathbb{Z}$ where the generator has infinite order.
- Structure: $G = \{\ldots, a^{-2}, a^{-1}, e, a, a^2, \ldots\}$
- All powers of $a$ are distinct
- $|G| = \infty$

**Finite Cyclic Groups**: Groups where the generator has finite order $n$.
- Structure: $G = \{e, a, a^2, \ldots, a^{n-1}\}$ where $a^n = e$
- Powers repeat after $n$ steps
- $|G| = n$

## Properties of Cyclic Groups

### Theorem 1: Cyclic Groups are Abelian

**Theorem**: Every cyclic group is abelian.

**Proof**: Let $G = \langle a \rangle$ be cyclic. For any $x, y \in G$, write $x = a^m$ and $y = a^n$ for some integers $m, n$. Then:
$$xy = a^m a^n = a^{m+n} = a^{n+m} = a^n a^m = yx$$

Therefore, $G$ is abelian. $\square$

**Important**: The converse is false. Not every abelian group is cyclic. For example, the Klein four-group $V_4 = \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ is abelian but not cyclic.

### Theorem 2: Subgroups of Cyclic Groups are Cyclic

**Theorem**: Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.

**Proof**: Let $G = \langle a \rangle$ be cyclic and $H \leq G$. If $H = \{e\}$, then $H = \langle e \rangle$ is cyclic.

Otherwise, $H$ contains some nonidentity element. Since elements of $G$ have the form $a^k$, and both $a^k$ and $a^{-k}$ are in $H$ (by the inverse property), $H$ contains positive powers of $a$.

Let $m$ be the smallest positive integer such that $a^m \in H$. We claim $H = \langle a^m \rangle$.

($\supseteq$) Clear since $a^m \in H$ and $H$ is a subgroup.

($\subseteq$) Let $a^k \in H$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. By the division algorithm, write $k = qm + r$ where $0 \leq r < m$. Then:
$$a^r = a^{k - qm} = a^k (a^m)^{-q} \in H$$

Since $0 \leq r < m$ and $m$ is minimal, we must have $r = 0$. Thus $k = qm$ and $a^k = (a^m)^q \in \langle a^m \rangle$.

Therefore, $H = \langle a^m \rangle$ is cyclic. $\square$

### Theorem 3: Order of Cyclic Group

**Theorem**: If $G = \langle a \rangle$, then $|G| = |a|$.

**Proof**: This follows from the relationship between element order and the size of the generated subgroup, proven in the previous section. $\square$

## Notation and Conventions

For a cyclic group of order $n$, we often use the notation:
- $C_n$ for an abstract cyclic group of order $n$
- $\mathbb{Z}_n$ for the specific realization as integers modulo $n$

**Isomorphism**: All cyclic groups of the same order are isomorphic (structurally identical). We'll formalize this later, but intuitively:
- Any finite cyclic group of order $n$ "looks like" $\mathbb{Z}_n$
- Any infinite cyclic group "looks like" $\mathbb{Z}$

## Non-Examples

Not every group is cyclic.

### Non-Example 1: Klein Four-Group

$V_4 = \{e, a, b, c\}$ with $a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e$ is not cyclic because:
- $\langle e \rangle = \{e\}$ has only 1 element
- $\langle a \rangle = \{e, a\}$ has only 2 elements
- $\langle b \rangle = \{e, b\}$ has only 2 elements
- $\langle c \rangle = \{e, c\}$ has only 2 elements

No single element generates all of $V_4$.

### Non-Example 2: Dihedral Group $D_n$ for $n \geq 3$

The dihedral group $D_n$ contains both rotations and reflections. No single element can generate both types of symmetries, so $D_n$ is not cyclic for $n \geq 3$.

**Example**: For $D_3$:
- Rotations generate only rotations: $\langle r \rangle = \{e, r, r^2\}$
- Reflections have order 2: $\langle f \rangle = \{e, f\}$

Neither generates the full group.

### Non-Example 3: $(\mathbb{Q}, +)$

The rational numbers under addition are not cyclic. Suppose $\mathbb{Q} = \langle a \rangle$ for some $a \in \mathbb{Q}$. Then $a = \frac{p}{q}$ for integers $p, q$ with $q \neq 0$.

Consider $\frac{a}{2} = \frac{p}{2q} \in \mathbb{Q}$. If $\mathbb{Q} = \langle a \rangle$, then $\frac{a}{2} = na$ for some integer $n$, giving:
$$\frac{p}{2q} = n \cdot \frac{p}{q} = \frac{np}{q}$$

This implies $\frac{1}{2} = n$, which is impossible for integer $n$.

Therefore, $\mathbb{Q}$ is not cyclic.

## Cayley Tables of Small Cyclic Groups

### $C_2 = \mathbb{Z}_2$
$$\begin{array}{c|cc}
+ & 0 & 1 \\
\hline
0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 0
\end{array}$$

### $C_3 = \mathbb{Z}_3$
$$\begin{array}{c|ccc}
+ & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
\hline
0 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
1 & 1 & 2 & 0 \\
2 & 2 & 0 & 1
\end{array}$$

### $C_4 = \mathbb{Z}_4$
$$\begin{array}{c|cccc}
+ & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
\hline
0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 0 \\
2 & 2 & 3 & 0 & 1 \\
3 & 3 & 0 & 1 & 2
\end{array}$$

Notice the pattern: each row is a cyclic shift of the previous row.

## Applications Preview

Cyclic groups appear throughout mathematics:
- **Number Theory**: $(\mathbb{Z}_n, +)$ and $U(p)$ for prime $p$
- **Cryptography**: Discrete logarithm problem in cyclic groups
- **Fourier Analysis**: Roots of unity in the DFT
- **Crystallography**: Rotational symmetries
- **Coding Theory**: Cyclic codes

## Summary

Cyclic groups are characterized by having a single generator:
- All cyclic groups are abelian
- All subgroups of cyclic groups are cyclic
- Every group of prime order is cyclic
- Cyclic groups are completely classified by their order

Understanding cyclic groups provides a foundation for studying more complex group structures.
