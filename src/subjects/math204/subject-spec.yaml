# ==============================================================================
# ASSESSMENT PHILOSOPHY
# ==============================================================================

assessment:
  philosophy: >
    Calculus II requires both computational fluency and conceptual understanding.
    Students must practice many integrals to develop pattern recognition, while
    also understanding why techniques work. Problem-solving should emphasize
    strategy selection as much as execution.

  measures:
    - Correct application of integration techniques
    - Proper setup of definite integrals for applications
    - Accurate convergence analysis with justification
    - Taylor series construction and error estimation

  anti_patterns:
    - Problems solvable by a single memorized formula
    - Integrals requiring tricks not taught in the course
    - Convergence questions answerable without showing work
    - Problems where any technique works equally well

# ==============================================================================
# GRADING THRESHOLDS
# ==============================================================================

grading:
  passing_score: 70

  thresholds:
    exercises: 70
    quizzes: 70
    exams: 65

  rationale: >
    Standard thresholds for a foundational STEM course. Slightly lower exam
    threshold acknowledges the time pressure of integration problems. Students
    need solid integration skills for upper-level mathematics and physics.

# ==============================================================================
# EXERCISE SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exercises:
  rationale: >
    Integration requires extensive practice to develop pattern recognition.
    Exercises progress from basic technique application to problems requiring
    strategy selection. Each topic needs sufficient drill and challenging problems.

  types:
    coding_with_tests: "0%"
    coding_ai_evaluated: "0%"
    written: "100%"
    justification: >
      Pure mathematics subject. All exercises are written solutions evaluated
      by AI against reference solutions. Focus on showing complete work.

  per_topic:
    minimum: 14
    target: 16
    maximum: 18
    justification: >
      Full base standard count. Integration technique mastery requires volume
      of practice. Each exercise should be completable in 10-20 minutes.
      16 exercises per topic provides sufficient variety.

  difficulty_distribution:
    1: 3
    2: 3
    3: 4
    4: 3
    5: 3
    justification: >
      Standard distribution. Difficulty 1-2 for technique practice, 3-4 for
      combined techniques, 5 for challenging applications. Balanced approach
      for an intermediate course.

# ==============================================================================
# QUIZ SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

quizzes:
  rationale: >
    Quizzes check formula recall, technique recognition, and basic computation.
    They prepare students for longer exercises by ensuring foundational knowledge.

  per_topic:
    count: 3
    questions_each: 5
    justification: >
      Standard base count. Three quizzes per topic: fundamentals, application,
      and mastery levels. 15 questions per topic provides broad coverage.

  question_types:
    multiple_choice: "50%"
    true_false: "15%"
    fill_blank: "20%"
    code_output: "0%"
    coding: "0%"
    written: "15%"
    justification: >
      Heavy on multiple choice for formula and technique recognition.
      Fill-blank for key integration results. Limited written for short
      computations. No coding for a pure mathematics course.

# ==============================================================================
# EXAM SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exams:
  rationale: >
    Exams test integration fluency under time pressure. Mix of computational
    problems and conceptual questions. Time allocation allows 2-3 minutes per
    question for basic problems, longer for proofs and applications.

    questions:
      minimum: 24
      target: 26
      maximum: 30

    Pure mathematics course assessed via problem sets and exams. The exercises
    effectively serve as ongoing practice. No separate projects needed.

# ==============================================================================
# SUBJECT-SPECIFIC RED FLAGS
# ==============================================================================

red_flags:
  - Integration problem solvable only with a trick not taught
  - Series convergence test not covered in the material
  - Application problem with ambiguous setup requirements
  - Taylor series problem requiring terms beyond what's reasonable by hand
  - Improper integral with non-obvious singularities

# ==============================================================================
# NOTES
# ==============================================================================

notes: >
  Calculus II is a critical transition course. Integration technique mastery
  is essential for later mathematics and physics courses. Content should
  emphasize pattern recognition and strategy selection. Series topics often
  feel disconnected from integration—content should bridge this gap by showing
  how series arise from integration problems (e.g., integral of 1/(1+x) = ln(1+x)
  and its series expansion).
