          "->",
          "%"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "The & operator (address-of operator) returns the memory address of a variable."

        "id": "cs105-q2-2",
        "type": "multiple_choice",

          "*ptr",
          "ptr->x"

        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "The * operator dereferences a pointer, accessing the value at the memory address it stores."

        "correctAnswer": "20",
        "explanation": "The pointer ptr points to x, so *ptr = 20 modifies x directly. Therefore x becomes 20."

        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "A NULL pointer is a special pointer value that indicates the pointer points to nothing (no valid memory location)."

        "correctAnswer": 1,

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Pointer arithmetic scales by the size of the pointed-to type. For int*, p+1 moves by sizeof(int) bytes."
