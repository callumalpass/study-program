# ==============================================================================
# PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH
# ==============================================================================

pedagogy:
  knowledge_type: mixed

  mastery_indicators:
    - Evaluates limits using algebraic techniques and L'Hôpital's Rule
    - Computes derivatives using multiple rules correctly
    - Identifies critical points and classifies extrema
    - Solves optimization word problems systematically

  common_struggles:
    - Forgetting to check for indeterminate forms before applying L'Hôpital
    - Confusing product rule with chain rule
    - Missing negative signs when differentiating
    - Setting up optimization problems incorrectly (wrong constraint)
    - Not distinguishing between local and global extrema
    - Related rates: confusing constants with variables

# ==============================================================================
# CONTENT STANDARDS
# ==============================================================================

content:
  subtopic_requirements:
    - Start each subtopic with motivation explaining why the concept matters
    - Include worked examples showing step-by-step calculations
    - Provide both computational and conceptual exercises
    - Use proper LaTeX notation for all mathematical expressions
    - Include common mistakes section where applicable

  conventions:
    - LaTeX for all mathematical expressions
    - Leibniz notation (dy/dx) as primary, Lagrange notation (f'(x)) as secondary
    - Standard function names (sin, cos, ln, exp)
    - Graphs and diagrams where visual intuition helps

# ==============================================================================
# ASSESSMENT PHILOSOPHY
# ==============================================================================

assessment:
  philosophy: >
    Calculus I requires both computational fluency and conceptual understanding.
    Students must be able to compute derivatives quickly and accurately, but also
    understand what derivatives represent and how to apply them. Assessments balance
    drill problems for fluency with word problems requiring setup and interpretation.

  measures:
    - Ability to compute derivatives using standard rules
    - Understanding of limits and continuity
    - Application of derivatives to optimization and related rates
    - Interpretation of derivatives in context (rates of change)
    - Curve sketching using calculus techniques

  anti_patterns:
    - Pure computation without context
    - Trick questions exploiting notation quirks
    - Problems requiring integration techniques
    - Memorization of specific problem types without understanding

# ==============================================================================
# GRADING THRESHOLDS
# ==============================================================================

grading:
  passing_score: 70

  thresholds:
    exercises: 70
    quizzes: 65
    exams: 65

  rationale: >
    Standard passing threshold appropriate for an intermediate math course.
    Students need solid computational skills that build on precalculus and serve
    as foundation for Calculus II and beyond. Slightly lower quiz/exam thresholds
    account for time pressure.

# ==============================================================================
# EXERCISE SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exercises:
  rationale: >
    Higher volume of exercises than base standard because computational fluency
    requires practice. Mix of drill problems for speed and application problems
    for depth. Exercises progress from basic differentiation to multi-step
    optimization and related rates problems.

  types:
    coding_with_tests: "0%"
    coding_ai_evaluated: "0%"
    written: "100%"
    justification: >
      Pure mathematics subject. All exercises are written (computations, proofs,
      word problems). AI evaluation compares student work against reference solutions.

  per_topic:
    minimum: 16
    target: 20
    maximum: 24
    justification: >
      Higher than base standard (20 vs 16) because calculus requires computational
      fluency. Many exercises are drill problems for speed building. Application
      problems require more thought but fewer repetitions.

  difficulty_distribution:
    1: 4
    2: 6
    3: 6
    4: 3
    5: 1
    justification: >
      Skewed toward easier difficulties for computational fluency. Many D1-D2
      exercises build speed with differentiation rules. D3-D4 for optimization
      and related rates. D5 for challenging applications.

# ==============================================================================
# QUIZ SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

quizzes:
  rationale: >
    Quizzes test conceptual understanding and ability to identify which technique
    applies. Mix of computation and interpretation questions ensures students
    understand meaning, not just mechanics.

  per_topic:
    count: 3
    questions_each: 5
    justification: >
      Standard base count. Three quizzes allow progression: basics, applications,
      and synthesis. 5 questions each provides adequate coverage without fatigue.

  question_types:
    multiple_choice: "50%"
    true_false: "15%"
    fill_blank: "20%"
    code_output: "0%"
    coding: "0%"
    written: "15%"
    justification: >
      Multiple choice for conceptual understanding and quick computation.
      Fill-blank for formulas and rules. Limited written for showing work
      on short problems. No coding in a pure math course.

# ==============================================================================
# EXAM SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exams:
  rationale: >
    Exams assess cumulative understanding with balanced computational and
    application problems. Time pressure tests fluency. Written problems
    require showing work for partial credit.

  midterm:
    questions:
      minimum: 25
      target: 28
      maximum: 32
    duration_minutes: 75
    format: >
      10-12 computation problems (limits, derivatives), 8-10 multiple choice
      conceptual questions, 5-8 short application problems (optimization setup,
      related rates).
    coverage: "Topics 1-4: Limits, derivatives, differentiation rules, applications"

  final:
    questions:
      minimum: 38
      target: 42
      maximum: 48
    duration_minutes: 120
    format: >
      15-18 computation problems across all topics, 12-15 multiple choice,
      10-14 application problems including optimization and related rates,
      2-3 curve sketching problems.
    coverage: "Comprehensive: all 7 topics with emphasis on applications"
    cumulative: true

# ==============================================================================
# PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

projects:
  required: false
  count: 0
  rationale: >
    Pure math courses assess via problem sets and exams rather than projects.
    The extensive exercise sets provide sufficient practice. Calculus problems
    are self-contained and don't benefit from project format.

# ==============================================================================
# SUBJECT-SPECIFIC RED FLAGS
# ==============================================================================

red_flags:
  - Exercise requires integration techniques not yet covered
  - Optimization problem has ambiguous constraints
  - Related rates problem missing essential given information
  - L'Hôpital's Rule applied to non-indeterminate form
  - Curve sketching without specifying domain
  - Quiz answer depends on calculator precision

# ==============================================================================
# NOTES
# ==============================================================================

notes: >
  Calculus I is foundational for all STEM disciplines. Content should balance
  rigorous computation with intuitive understanding. Students should leave
  knowing not just how to differentiate, but why derivatives matter for
  modeling change. Real-world applications (physics, economics, biology)
  make concepts concrete. The 7 subtopics per topic requirement means adding
  capstone/summary subtopics where current topics have only 6.
