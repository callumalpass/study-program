# ==============================================================================
# PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH
# ==============================================================================

pedagogy:
  knowledge_type: applied

  mastery_indicators:
    - Builds responsive, accessible web pages from scratch
    - Writes clean, modular JavaScript with proper event handling
    - Uses modern CSS layouts (Flexbox, Grid) appropriately
    - Implements asynchronous operations with proper error handling
    - Integrates external APIs and manages application state
    - Follows web accessibility best practices (semantic HTML, ARIA)
    - Uses browser developer tools effectively for debugging

  common_struggles:
    - CSS specificity and cascade order confusion
    - Understanding the asynchronous nature of JavaScript
    - Event bubbling and delegation patterns
    - Managing state in larger applications
    - Cross-browser compatibility issues
    - Responsive breakpoint design decisions
    - Accessibility requirements beyond basic compliance

# ==============================================================================
# CONTENT STANDARDS
# ==============================================================================

content:
  subtopic_requirements:
    - Every concept demonstrated with working code examples
    - Show browser DevTools debugging techniques where relevant
    - Include common mistakes and how to fix them
    - Progressive examples building from simple to complex
    - Emphasize accessibility considerations throughout

  conventions:
    - HTML5 semantic elements and valid markup
    - Modern CSS (Flexbox, Grid, CSS variables, modern selectors)
    - ES6+ JavaScript (const/let, arrow functions, template literals, modules)
    - All code examples must be copy-paste runnable in a browser
    - Include browser compatibility notes where relevant

# ==============================================================================
# ASSESSMENT PHILOSOPHY
# ==============================================================================

assessment:
  philosophy: >
    Web development is learned by building. Projects and exercises should create
    real, functional web content. Immediate visual feedback from the browser
    motivates learning. Assessments should test practical skills: can the student
    build it and does it work correctly?

  measures:
    - Code correctness and functionality
    - Proper use of semantic HTML and accessibility features
    - CSS layout skills and responsive design implementation
    - JavaScript DOM manipulation and event handling
    - Asynchronous programming patterns
    - Code organization and best practices

  anti_patterns:
    - Asking about browser-specific quirks that change frequently
    - Testing memorization of CSS property names without context
    - Problems requiring deprecated or non-standard features
    - Ignoring accessibility in favor of visual-only solutions

# ==============================================================================
# GRADING THRESHOLDS
# ==============================================================================

grading:
  passing_score: 70

  thresholds:
    exercises: 70
    quizzes: 65
    exams: 65

  rationale: >
    Standard passing threshold. Web development has immediate visual feedback,
    making it easier to iterate until code works. Lower quiz/exam thresholds
    because conceptual questions can be tricky even when students can build
    working applications.

# ==============================================================================
# EXERCISE SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exercises:
  rationale: >
    High volume of practical exercises builds fluency with HTML, CSS, and
    JavaScript. Each exercise produces visible results in the browser, providing
    immediate motivation. Exercises progress from single-concept to multi-concept
    integration, preparing students for larger projects.

  types:
    coding_with_tests: "90%"
    coding_ai_evaluated: "10%"
    written: "0%"
    justification: >
      Almost all exercises are coding with automated tests for immediate
      feedback. Some design/styling exercises use AI evaluation since visual
      outcomes can have multiple valid approaches. No written exercises - this
      is a hands-on, build-it course.

  per_topic:
    minimum: 14
    target: 16
    maximum: 18
    justification: >
      Full base standard count. Web development benefits from volume of practice
      across HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each exercise is small and focused,
      building skills incrementally.

  difficulty_distribution:
    1: 3
    2: 3
    3: 4
    4: 3
    5: 3
    justification: >
      Standard distribution. Web development has a gradual learning curve.
      Beginner exercises build confidence with basic syntax and structures.
      Expert exercises integrate multiple concepts (responsive layouts with
      async data fetching, accessible interactive components).

# ==============================================================================
# QUIZ SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

quizzes:
  rationale: >
    Quizzes test conceptual understanding and code reading skills that
    complement hands-on exercises. They ensure students understand why
    certain approaches work, not just how to copy patterns.

  per_topic:
    count: 3
    questions_each: 5
    justification: >
      Standard base count. Three quizzes per topic: fundamentals, application,
      and mastery levels. Allows testing of conceptual knowledge separate from
      practical building skills.

  question_types:
    multiple_choice: "45%"
    true_false: "15%"
    fill_blank: "10%"
    code_output: "30%"
    coding: "0%"
    written: "0%"
    justification: >
      Heavy on code_output to test whether students can trace JavaScript
      execution and predict DOM states. Multiple choice for conceptual
      understanding (CSS specificity, semantic HTML choices). Fill-blank
      for syntax patterns. No coding in quizzes - exercises handle that.

# ==============================================================================
# EXAM SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

exams:
  rationale: >
    Exams test understanding without browser/IDE assistance. Mix of code
    tracing, conceptual questions, and short coding problems. Students should
    demonstrate they understand the material, not just that they can Google it.

  midterm:
    questions:
      minimum: 24
      target: 26
      maximum: 30
    duration_minutes: 90
    format: >
      8-10 code tracing questions (HTML/CSS/JS output), 10-12 multiple choice
      conceptual questions (semantic HTML, CSS rules, JS behavior), 4-6 short
      coding problems (write a function, CSS rule, or HTML structure).
    coverage: "Topics 1-4: HTML, CSS, JavaScript Fundamentals, DOM Manipulation"

  final:
    questions:
      minimum: 38
      target: 42
      maximum: 48
    duration_minutes: 180
    format: >
      12-15 code tracing, 15-18 multiple choice, 8-12 short coding problems.
      Cumulative with emphasis on later topics (responsive design, async JS,
      modern tooling). At least one problem integrating HTML, CSS, and JS.
    coverage: "Comprehensive: all 7 topics"
    cumulative: true

# ==============================================================================
# PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
# ==============================================================================

projects:
  required: true
  count: 3
  rationale: >
    Web development is fundamentally about building complete applications.
    Three projects at increasing complexity: static site, interactive app,
    and API-integrated dashboard. Each project builds on skills from previous
    topics and creates portfolio pieces students can show employers.

  goals:
    - Build complete, functional web applications
    - Integrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills
    - Practice responsive design and accessibility
    - Work with external APIs and asynchronous data
    - Create portfolio pieces for job applications

  estimated_hours: "15-25"

# ==============================================================================
# SUBJECT-SPECIFIC RED FLAGS
# ==============================================================================

red_flags:
  - Exercise requires browser-specific APIs not covered in content
  - CSS exercise has only one "correct" visual solution
  - Test expects exact pixel measurements for responsive layouts
  - Code example uses deprecated HTML elements or attributes
  - JavaScript example uses var instead of const/let without pedagogical reason
  - Accessibility is treated as optional or afterthought
  - Solution works only in a specific browser

# ==============================================================================
# NOTES
# ==============================================================================

notes: >
  Web development is highly visual and tactile. Content should encourage
  students to experiment in browser DevTools. Error messages in browsers
  are often cryptic - explain common ones. Emphasize that web standards
  evolve, so the skill is learning how to learn, not memorizing current APIs.
  Accessibility should be woven throughout, not relegated to a single topic.
