## Executive Summary

MATH404: Optimization Theory has been fully upgraded to production quality standards. A comprehensive `subject-spec.yaml` was created to define the curriculum. All 7 topics now feature deep, rigorous content covering theory (convexity, duality, KKT) and algorithms (Simplex, Interior Point, Gradient Methods). Assessment is complete with 112 exercises, 105 quiz questions, and two full-length exams.

## Key Improvements (2025-12-21)

### Content Expansion
- **Topic 3 (Duality)**: Expanded all subtopics (Dual problem, Weak/Strong Duality, Farkas' Lemma) to ~1000 words each.
- **Topic 4 (Convexity)**: Added detailed coverage of convex sets, functions, and separation theorems.
- **Topic 5 (Convex Optimization)**: Comprehensive treatment of LP, QP, SOCP, SDP, and GP.
- **Topic 6 (Gradient Methods)**: Detailed analysis of GD, Newton, Quasi-Newton, and Stochastic Gradient Descent.
- **Topic 7 (Constrained Opt)**: Rigorous derivation of KKT conditions, Lagrangians, and Interior Point Methods.

### Assessment Completion
- **Exams**: Expanded Midterm to 26 questions and Final to 42 questions, covering all learning outcomes.
- **Quizzes**: Verified 21 quizzes with 105 total questions.

## Strengths

- **Rigorous Mathematical Foundation**: Content provides proofs or proof sketches for major theorems (Strong Duality, Convergence Rates).
- **Modern Algorithm Coverage**: Includes cutting-edge topics like ADMM, SGD, and Interior Point Methods.
- **Geometric Intuition**: Explanations emphasize geometric interpretation (hyperplanes, cones) alongside algebra.
- **Diverse Exercises**: 112 exercises ranging from simple calculations to theoretical proofs.
