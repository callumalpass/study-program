| Quiz Quality | 2/10 | Insufficient questions per topic (2-3 vs required 15) |
| Exam Quality | 8/10 | Both midterm and final present with good coverage |
| Project Quality | N/A | Not applicable for MATH subjects |
| Technical Correctness | 9/10 | Mathematical notation correct, solutions accurate |
| **Overall** | 7/10 | Exercises complete; quizzes and subtopic content need expansion |

## Executive Summary

MATH404: Optimization Theory has achieved production quality for exercises with 16 well-designed exercises per topic (112 total), covering the full difficulty range from basic concept verification to advanced proof-based problems. Topic 1 (Problem Formulation) features comprehensive content with 800+ words per subtopic. The remaining content gaps are: Topics 2-7 need subtopic expansion to 800+ words each, and quizzes need additional questions.

## Recent Updates (2025-12-20)

### Exercises Completed
- **Topic 4 (Convex Sets and Functions)**: Added 16 exercises covering convex set verification, convex combinations, Jensen's inequality, Hessian tests, operations preserving convexity, and conjugate functions
- **Topic 5 (Unconstrained Optimization)**: Added 16 exercises covering gradient descent, Newton's method, line search methods, momentum, BFGS, conjugate gradient, SGD, proximal methods, and Nesterov acceleration
- **Topic 6 (Constrained Optimization)**: Added 16 exercises covering Lagrangians, KKT conditions, penalty methods, barrier methods, augmented Lagrangian, interior point methods, SQP, and active set methods
- **Topic 7 (Advanced Topics)**: Added 16 exercises covering SOCP, SDP, MAX-CUT relaxation, robust optimization, integer programming, branch and bound, cutting planes, geometric programming, stochastic programming, and ADMM

## Strengths

- **Complete Exercise Coverage**: 16 exercises per topic with progressive difficulty (D1: 3, D2: 3, D3: 4, D4: 3, D5: 3)
- **Topic 1 Content Excellence**: Topic 1 has 7 comprehensive subtopics, each with 800+ words
- **Strong Technical Foundation**: Mathematical notation is correct throughout
- **Complete Exam Structure**: Both midterm and final exam are present
- **Practical Code Examples**: Python implementations using scipy, cvxpy, and numpy
- **Comprehensive Exercise Solutions**: All exercises include detailed solutions and hints

## Remaining Issues

1. **Underdeveloped Content (Topics 2-7)**: Most subtopics in Topics 2-7 are below 800 words
2. **Insufficient Quiz Questions**: Topics have 2-5 questions each, need 15 per topic

## Improvements Needed

1. **Priority 1 - Content Expansion**: Expand all subtopics in Topics 2-7 to minimum 800 words with:
   - Detailed mathematical explanations
   - Worked examples with step-by-step solutions
   - Python code implementations
   - Visualizations and diagrams

2. **Priority 2 - Quiz Expansion**: Expand quizzes to 15 questions per topic (3 quizzes x 5 questions)

## Exercise Summary by Topic

| Topic | Title | Exercises | Difficulty Distribution |
|-------|-------|-----------|------------------------|
| 1 | Problem Formulation | 16/16 | D1:3, D2:3, D3:4, D4:3, D5:3 |
| 2 | Linear Programming | 16/16 | D1:3, D2:3, D3:4, D4:3, D5:3 |
| 3 | Duality Theory | 16/16 | D1:3, D2:3, D3:4, D4:3, D5:3 |
| 4 | Convex Sets and Functions | 16/16 | D1:3, D2:3, D3:4, D4:3, D5:3 |
| 5 | Unconstrained Optimization | 16/16 | D1:3, D2:3, D3:4, D4:3, D5:3 |
| 6 | Constrained Optimization | 16/16 | D1:3, D2:3, D3:4, D4:3, D5:3 |
| 7 | Advanced Topics | 16/16 | D1:3, D2:3, D3:4, D4:3, D5:3 |

**Total Exercises: 112/112**

## Conclusion

MATH404: Optimization Theory now meets the exercise requirements with 112 well-designed exercises. The primary remaining work is subtopic content expansion for Topics 2-7 and quiz question development. The exercises cover the full range of optimization theory including linear programming, convex optimization, gradient methods, constrained optimization, and advanced topics like SDP/SOCP.
