## Technical Issues Found

None. All reviewed code examples, complexity analyses, algorithm implementations, and explanations are technically accurate.

## Recommendations

1. **Add More Projects (Priority: Medium)**
   - Current: 1 project (Maze Solver using BFS and A*)
   - Recommendation: Add 1-2 more substantial projects:
     - **Sorting Visualizer**: Implement and animate 4-5 different sorting algorithms with performance comparisons
     - **DP Problem Solver**: Implement solutions to 3-4 classic DP problems (LCS, Knapsack, Edit Distance) with step-by-step visualization of the DP table
   - These would provide more hands-on algorithmic implementation experience

2. **Consider Adding Real-World Case Studies (Priority: Low)**
   - Each topic could benefit from a dedicated "Real-World Applications" section showing how these algorithms are used in industry
   - Examples: Database query optimization (sorting), Google Maps (shortest paths), DNA sequence alignment (DP)

3. **Add Performance Benchmarking Exercises (Priority: Low)**
   - Optional advanced exercises where students implement algorithms and measure actual performance
   - Helps students understand the difference between theoretical complexity and practical performance

4. **Create Summary/Cheat Sheets (Priority: Low)**
   - Consider adding downloadable PDF cheat sheets for each topic
   - Quick reference for complexity classes, algorithm selection criteria, etc.

## Conclusion

CS201: Algorithms is an **exemplary subject implementation** that exceeds all requirements and demonstrates exceptional pedagogical quality. The content is comprehensive, technically accurate, well-structured, and pedagogically sound. All quantitative requirements are met (16 exercises, 15 quizzes, 800+ words per subtopic), and the qualitative aspects are outstanding with clear explanations, excellent visualizations, and progressive difficulty.

The subject is **ready for production use** as-is. The suggested improvements are minor enhancements that would make an already excellent resource even better, but they are not necessary for the subject to function effectively as a complete algorithms course.

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT (9.7/10)**

This subject serves as a model for how CS curriculum should be implemented in this platform.
