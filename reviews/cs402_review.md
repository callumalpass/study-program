- Quality assurance: 4-6 hours

**Total: 63-79 hours**

## Conclusion

CS402 demonstrates excellent potential with high-quality content for Topics 1-6, exceptional project design, and strong technical accuracy. However, it requires substantial work to meet completion standards: 64 exercises for Topics 1-4, 90 quiz questions for 6 topics, Topic 7 content expansion, and exam completion.

**Recommended Action:** Prioritize exercises and quizzes for Topics 1-4 first, then complete Topics 5-7 exercises, expand Topic 7 content, and finally complete exams.
