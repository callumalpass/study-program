## Executive Summary

CS403 has a solid foundation with well-structured topics covering advanced algorithms comprehensively, and excellent project definitions with detailed rubrics. However, the subject is severely incomplete in terms of exercises (only 2 per topic instead of 16), quizzes (only 15 total instead of 105), and content depth (many subtopics well below the 800-word requirement). The topics that do have content show good technical quality, but significant expansion is needed across all areas.

## Strengths

- **Excellent topic coverage**: 7 topics spanning NP-completeness, approximation algorithms, randomized algorithms, online algorithms, dynamic programming, network flow, and computational geometry
- **Outstanding projects**: 3 well-designed projects with comprehensive rubrics covering SAT solver implementation, approximation algorithms library, and computational geometry toolkit
- **High-quality existing content**: Where content exists (particularly Topics 1-3), it demonstrates strong technical depth with proper mathematical notation, code examples, and clear explanations
- **Good exercise quality**: The 14 exercises that exist are well-designed with proper starter code, solutions, test cases, and hints
- **Logical curriculum flow**: Topics build on each other appropriately for a Year 4 advanced algorithms course

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

1. **SEVERE EXERCISE DEFICIT**: Only 2 exercises per topic (14 total) vs required 16 per topic (112 total)
   - **Missing: 98 exercises** across all 7 topics
   - Each topic needs 14 additional exercises

2. **SEVERE QUIZ DEFICIT**: Only 15 quiz questions total vs required 105 (15 per topic × 7 topics)
   - **Missing: 90 quiz questions**
   - Current distribution is uneven (3 questions for Topic 1, 2 for Topic 2, etc.)

3. **MINIMAL EXAM CONTENT**:
   - Midterm has only 2 questions (need ~20)
   - Final has only 1 question (need ~25)
   - **Missing: 42+ exam questions**

4. **WORD COUNT DEFICIENCIES**: Many subtopics severely below 800-word requirement
   - Topic 5 subtopics: ~77 words (should be 800+)
   - Topic 7 subtopics: ~20 words (should be 800+)
   - Topics 4-7 particularly affected

## Technical Issues Found

**Minor issues:**
1. Topic naming mismatch: topics.ts lists Topic 5 as "Advanced Dynamic Programming" but content folder structure suggests it's "Network Flow" (folder topic-5 contains max-flow files)
2. Topic naming mismatch: topics.ts lists Topic 6 as "Network Flow Algorithms" but content suggests it's "Advanced Dynamic Programming" (folder topic-6 contains matrix-chain, edit-distance files)
3. Quiz distribution is completely uneven - should reorganize to have exactly 3 quizzes × 5 questions per topic

**Content quality where present:**
- Code examples are syntactically correct and well-commented
- Mathematical notation uses proper LaTeX/KaTeX
- Explanations are clear and pedagogically sound
- Algorithms are correctly described
- Reductions are properly proven

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Week 1-2)
1. **Fix topic naming confusion** in topics.ts - swap Topic 5 and Topic 6 definitions to match content
2. **Create exercise templates** for all 7 topics to establish patterns
3. **Expand Topic 4 content** as it's partially complete and easier to finish

### Short-term (Weeks 3-6)
4. **Complete Topics 5-7 content** - these need full writing from scratch
   - Start with Topic 5 (Network Flow) as it has foundational importance
   - Then Topic 6 (Dynamic Programming)
   - Finally Topic 7 (Computational Geometry)
5. **Create quiz question bank** - write 90 new quiz questions with proper distribution
6. **Expand exam questions** - write 42 additional exam questions

### Medium-term (Weeks 7-10)
7. **Create remaining exercises** - 98 exercises across all topics
   - Prioritize Topics 1-3 as content is complete
   - Ensure difficulty progression (easy → hard)
   - Include both implementation and analysis exercises
8. **Add more code examples** to expanded content
9. **Create practice problem sets** linking to exercises

### Quality Assurance
10. **Technical review** of all new content for correctness
11. **Pedagogical review** to ensure proper learning progression
12. **Cross-reference checking** between topics, exercises, and quizzes
13. **Word count verification** for all subtopics
14. **Test all code examples** and solutions

## Estimated Completion Time

Based on the gaps identified:
- **Content writing:** ~80 hours (17,582 words @ 220 words/hour)
- **Exercise creation:** ~98 hours (98 exercises @ 1 hour each)
- **Quiz creation:** ~30 hours (90 questions @ 20 min each)
- **Exam creation:** ~14 hours (42 questions @ 20 min each)
- **Review and quality assurance:** ~20 hours

**Total estimated time: ~242 hours** (approximately 6 weeks full-time or 12 weeks half-time)

## Conclusion

CS403 has an excellent curriculum structure and outstanding project definitions, demonstrating strong pedagogical design. However, it is significantly incomplete in terms of exercises, quizzes, exams, and substantial content for Topics 4-7. The existing content for Topics 1-3 is of high quality, providing a good template for the remaining work.

The subject requires substantial effort to complete, but the foundation is solid. Priority should be given to:
1. Expanding content for Topics 5-7 (completely empty)
2. Creating the missing 98 exercises
3. Writing the missing 90 quiz questions
4. Expanding exam content

Once completed, this will be an excellent advanced algorithms course suitable for Year 4 CS students.
