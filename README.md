# stu.p

**stu.p** is a **stu**dy **p**rogram: a self-study platform with readings, exercises, quizzes, and exams.

## Why

A good curriculum provides structure: prerequisites, exercises that build on each other, exams that force you to actually learn the material. This project attempts to provide that structure for self-study. It's a static site—your progress stays in your browser or syncs to your own GitHub Gist.

It's meant to be difficult in the way university courses are difficult. There are prerequisites, timed exams, and projects with rubrics. Unlike most difficult material online, this actually checks your work.

The content is written by AI. The prompts and quality standards used to generate it are in `docs/`. You can also use AI (via your own Gemini API key) to get feedback on written exercises and projects.

## What This Is

This is a structured learning environment covering a growing catalog of subjects; the current content focuses on computer science and mathematics. Each subject contains reading material, exercises, quizzes, and exams. The platform tracks your progress locally and optionally syncs it to a GitHub Gist.

The curriculum follows prerequisite chains typical of formal programs. You can study subjects in any order, but the platform indicates when prerequisites are incomplete.

## Content Structure

Each subject is divided into 7 topics. Topics are further divided into subtopics (separate markdown pages of ~1000 words each). This allows incremental reading rather than scrolling through monolithic documents.

Subjects include:
- Quizzes (multiple choice, true/false, code output prediction, fill-in-blank)
- Coding exercises with automated test case validation
- Written exercises for math and theory subjects
- Longer projects with rubrics
- Practice exams (midterm and final)

Not all subjects have complete content yet. The status of each subject is visible in the interface.

## How Exercises Work

**Coding exercises**: Python code runs directly in the browser using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/). C exercises use JSCPP for interpretation. When you submit code, it runs against visible and hidden test cases. The expected output is generated by running the reference solution against each test case.

**Written exercises**: For math proofs and theoretical questions, there's no automated validation. If you configure a Gemini API key in settings, you can request AI evaluation. The AI compares your answer to a reference solution and provides a score and feedback. This is optional.

**Projects**: Larger assignments with multiple requirements and a grading rubric. You can self-assess or request AI evaluation if you have a Gemini API key configured.

## Progress Storage

Progress saves to `localStorage` under the key `cs_degree_progress`. This includes quiz attempts, exercise completions, project submissions, and topic view history.

### GitHub Gist Sync

You can optionally sync progress to a private GitHub Gist. This requires a GitHub personal access token with gist scope. The sync is manual (push/pull buttons in settings), not automatic. Settings (API keys, tokens) are never synced—only learning progress data.

This allows you to continue on another device or browser, or keep a backup.

## Study Timeline

The timeline feature lets you create a study plan with a start date and pace:
- Standard: ~4 years (2 weeks per topic)
- Accelerated: ~2 years (1 week per topic)
- Intensive: ~1 year (2 topics per week)

The timeline displays as a Gantt chart showing scheduled, in-progress, and completed subjects. It respects prerequisite dependencies when scheduling. You can drag subjects to reschedule them.

## Running Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Opens at http://localhost:5173

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

Output goes to `dist/`. The project deploys to GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

## Dependencies

- Vite (build tool)
- TypeScript
- Monaco Editor (code editing)
- Pyodide (Python in browser)
- JSCPP (C/C++ interpretation)
- KaTeX (math rendering)
- Marked (markdown parsing)
- Prism.js (syntax highlighting)
- jsPDF (PDF export)

## API Keys

Two optional API keys can be configured in settings:

- **GitHub token**: For gist sync (requires `gist` scope)
- **Gemini API key**: For AI evaluation of written exercises and projects

Both are stored in `localStorage` only and never leave the browser except when making API calls.
